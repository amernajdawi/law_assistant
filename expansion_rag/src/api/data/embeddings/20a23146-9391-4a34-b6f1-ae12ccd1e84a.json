Requirements for the manufacturer 1. Addressing the environmental aspects identified in the implementing measure as capable of being influenced in a substantial manner through product design, manufacturers of products must perform an assessment of the product model throughout its lifecycle, based upon realistic assumptions about normal conditions and purposes of use. Other environmental aspects may be examined on a voluntary basis. On the basis of this assessment, manufacturers must establish the product's ecological profile. It must be based on environmentally relevant product characteristics and inputs/outputs throughout the product life cycle expressed in physical quantities that can be measured. 2. Manufacturers must make use of this assessment to evaluate alternative design solutions and the achieved environ\u00ad mental performance of the product against benchmarks. The benchmarks must be identified by the Commission in the implementing measure on the basis of information gathered during the preparation of the measure. The choice of a specific design solution must achieve a reasonable balance between the various environmental aspects and between environmental aspects and other relevant considerations, such as safety and health, technical requirements for functionality, quality, and performance, and economic aspects, including manufacturing costs and marketability, while complying with all relevant legislation.\n\nL 285/26 EN Official Journal of the European Union 31.10.2009 ANNEX II Method for setting specific ecodesign requirements (referred to in Article 15(6)) Specific ecodesign requirements aim at improving a selected environmental aspect of the product. They may take the form of requirements for reduced consumption of a given resource, such as a limit on the use of a resource in the various stages of an product\u2019s life cycle, as appropriate (such as a limit on water consumption in the use phase or on the quantities of a given material incorporated in the product or a requirement for minimum quantities of recycled material). In preparing implementing measures laying down specific ecodesign requirements pursuant to Article 15, the Commission must identify, as appropriate to the product covered by the implementing measure, the relevant ecodesign parameters from among those referred to in Annex I, Part 1, and set the levels of these requirements, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 19(2), as follows: 1. A technical, environmental and economic analysis must select a number of representative models of the product in question on the market and identify the technical options for improving the environmental performance of the product, keeping sight of the economic viability of the options and avoiding any significant loss of performance or of usefulness for consumers. The technical, environmental and economic analysis must also identify, for the environmental aspects under consideration, the best-performing products and technology available on the market. The performance of products available on international markets and benchmarks set in other countries\u2019 legislation should be taken into consideration during the analysis as well as when setting requirements. On the basis of this analysis, and taking into account economic and technical feasibility as well as the potential for improvement, concrete measures must be taken with a view to minimising the product\u2019s environmental impact. Concerning energy consumption in use, the level of energy efficiency or consumption must be set aiming at the life cycle cost minimum to end-users for representative product models, taking into account the consequences on other environmental aspects. The life cycle cost analysis method uses a real discount rate on the basis of data provided from the European Central Bank and a realistic lifetime for the product; it is based on the sum of the variations in purchase price (resulting from the variations in industrial costs) and in operating expenses, which result from the different levels of technical improvement options, discounted over the lifetime of the representative product models considered. The operating expenses cover primarily energy consumption and additional expenses in other resources, such as water or detergents. A sensitivity analysis covering the relevant factors, such as the price of energy or other resource, the cost of raw materials or production costs, discount rates, and, where appropriate, external environmental costs, including avoided greenhouse gas emissions, must be carried out to check if", "embedding_index": 14}, {"chunk_id": "20a23146-9391-4a34-b6f1-ae12ccd1e84a_15", "text": " in operating expenses, which result from the different levels of technical improvement options, discounted over the lifetime of the representative product models considered.

The requirement will be adapted accordingly. A similar methodology may be applied to other resources such as water. 2. For the development of the technical, environmental and economic analyses, information available in the framework of other Community activities may be used. The same applies for information available from existing programmes applied in other parts of the world for setting the specific ecodesign requirement of products traded with the European Union\u2019s economic partners. 3. The date of entry into force of the requirement must take the redesign cycle for the product into account.\n\n31.10.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 285/27 ANNEX III CE marking (referred to in Article 5(2)) The CE marking must have a height of at least 5 mm.

Openness of participation Self-regulatory initiatives must be open to the participation of third country operators, both in the preparatory and in the implementation phases. 2. Added value Self-regulatory initiatives must deliver added value (more than \u2018business as usual\u2019) in terms of the improved overall environmental performance of the product covered. 3. Representativeness Industry and their associations taking part in a self-regulatory action must represent a large majority of the relevant economic sector, with as few exceptions as possible. Care must be taken to ensure respect for competition rules. 4. Quantified and staged objectives The objectives defined by the stakeholders must be set in clear and unambiguous terms, starting from a well-defined baseline. If the self-regulatory initiative covers a long time-span, interim targets must be included. It must be possible to monitor compliance with objectives and (interim) targets in an affordable and credible way using clear and reliable indicators. Research information and scientific and technological background data must facilitate the development of these indicators. 5. Involvement of civil society With a view to ensuring transparency, self-regulatory initiatives must be publicised, including through the use of the Internet and other electronic means of disseminating information. The same must apply to interim and final monitoring reports. Stakeholders including Member States, industry, environmental NGOs and consumers\u2019 associations must be invited to comment on a self-regulatory initiative. 6. Monitoring and reporting Self-regulatory initiatives must contain a well-designed monitoring system, with clearly identified responsibilities for industry and independent inspectors. The Commission services, in partnership with the parties to the self-regulatory initiative, must be invited to monitor the achievement of the objectives. The plan for monitoring and reporting must be detailed, transparent and objective.

Cost-effectiveness of administering a self-regulatory initiative The cost of administering self-regulatory initiatives, in particular as regards monitoring, must not lead to a dispro\u00ad portionate administrative burden, as compared to their objectives and to other available policy instruments.\n\nL 285/34 EN Official Journal of the European Union 31.10.2009 8. Sustainability Self-regulatory initiatives must respond to the policy objectives of this Directive, including the integrated approach, and must be consistent with the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development. The protection of the interests of consumers, health, quality of life and economic interests, must be integrated. 9. Incentive compatibility Self-regulatory initiatives are unlikely to deliver the expected results if other factors and incentives \u2014 market pressure, taxes, and legislation at national level \u2014 send contradictory signals to participants in the self-regulatory initiative. Policy consistency is essential in this regard and must be taken into consideration when assessing the effectiveness of the initiative.
