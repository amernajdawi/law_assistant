For micro- cogeneration units the calculation may be based on certified values. (a) Electricity production from cogeneration shall be considered equal to total annual electricity production of the unit measured at the outlet of the main generators; (i) in cogeneration units of types (b), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) referred to in Part II with an annual overall efficiency set by Member States at a level of at least 75 %, and (ii) in cogeneration units of types (a) and (c) referred to in Part II with an annual overall efficiency set by Member States at a level of at least 80 %. (b) In cogeneration units with an annual overall efficiency below the value referred to in point (i) of point (a) (cogen\u00ad eration units of types (b), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) referred to in Part II) or with an annual overall efficiency below the value referred to in point (ii) of point (a) (cogeneration units of types (a) and (c) referred to in Part II) cogeneration is calculated according to the following formula: E C HP =H C HP *C where: E C HP is the amount of electricity from cogeneration; C is the power-to-heat ratio; H CHP is the amount of useful heat from", "embedding_index": 28}, {"chunk_id": "62013b61-45c0-4f00-8687-41b7d4bbeb01_29", "text": ") referred to in Part II) or with an annual overall efficiency below the value referred to in point (ii) of point (a) (cogeneration units of types (a) and (c) referred to in Part II) cogeneration is calculated according to the following formula: E C HP =H C HP *C where: E C HP is the amount of electricity from cogeneration; C is the power-to-heat ratio; H CHP is the amount of useful heat from cogeneration (calculated for this purpose as total heat production minus any heat produced in separate boilers or by live steam extraction from the steam generator before the turbine). The calculation of electricity from cogeneration must be based on the actual power-to-heat ratio. If the actual power- to-heat ratio of a cogeneration unit is not known, the following default values may be used, in particular for statistical purposes, for units of types (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) referred to in Part II provided that the calculated cogeneration electricity is less or equal to total electricity production of the unit: Type of the unit Default power to heat ratio, C Combined cycle gas turbine 0,95 with heat recovery Steam back pressure turbine 0,45 Steam condensing extraction 0,45 turbine Gas turbine with heat 0,55 recovery Internal combustion engine 0,75 If Member States introduce default values for power-to-heat ratios for units of types (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) referred to in Part II, such default values shall be published and shall be notified to the Commission. (c) If a share of the energy content of the fuel input to the cogeneration process is recovered in chemicals and recycled this share can be subtracted from the fuel input before calculating the overall efficiency used in points (a) and (b). (d) Member States may determine the power-to-heat ratio as the ratio of electricity to useful heat when operating in cogeneration mode at a lower capacity using operational data of the specific unit. (e) Member States may use other reporting periods than one year for the purpose of the calculations according to points (a) and (b).\n\nL 315/30 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2012 Part II Cogeneration technologies covered by this Directive (a) Combined cycle gas turbine with heat recovery (b) Steam back pressure turbine (c) Steam condensing extraction turbine (d) Gas turbine with heat recovery (e) Internal combustion engine (f) Microturbines (g) Stirling engines (h) Fuel cells (i) Steam engines (j) Organic Rankine cycles (k) Any other type of technology or combination thereof falling under the definition laid down in Article 2(30).

(a) High-efficiency cogeneration For the purpose of this Directive high-efficiency cogeneration shall fulfil the following criteria: \u2014 cogeneration production from cogeneration units shall provide primary energy savings calculated according to point (b) of at least 10 % compared with the references for separate production of heat and electricity, \u2014 production from small-scale and micro-cogeneration units providing primary energy savings may qualify as high- efficiency cogeneration. (b) Calculation of primary energy savings The amount of primary energy savings provided by cogeneration production defined in accordance with Annex I shall be calculated on the basis of the following formula: Where: PES is primary energy savings. CHP H\u03b7 is the heat efficiency of the cogeneration production defined as annual useful heat output divided by the fuel input used to produce the sum of useful heat output and electricity from cogeneration. Ref H\u03b7 is the efficiency reference value for separate heat production. CHP E\u03b7 is the electrical efficiency of the cogeneration production defined as annual electricity from cogeneration divided by the fuel input used to produce the sum of useful heat output and electricity from cogeneration.

(c) Calculations of energy savings using alternative calculation Member States may calculate primary energy savings from a production of heat and electricity and mechanical energy as indicated below without applying Annex I to exclude the non-cogenerated heat and electricity parts of the same process. Such a production can be regarded as high-efficiency cogeneration provided it fulfils the efficiency criteria in point (a) of this Annex and, for cogeneration units with an electrical capacity larger than 25 MW, the overall efficiency is above 70 %. However, specification of the quantity of electricity from cogeneration produced in such a production, for issuing a guarantee of origin and for statistical purposes, shall be determined in accordance with Annex I.\n\nL 315/32 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2012 If primary energy savings for a process are calculated using alternative calculation as indicated above the primary energy savings shall be calculated using the formula in point (b) of this Annex replacing: \u2018CHP H\u03b7\u2019 with \u2018H\u03b7\u2019 and \u2018CHP E\u03b7\u2019 with \u2018E\u03b7\u2019, where: H\u03b7 shall mean the heat efficiency of the process, defined as the annual heat output divided by the fuel input used to produce the sum of heat output and electricity output.

Where a cogeneration unit generates mechanical energy, the annual electricity from cogeneration may be increased by an additional element representing the amount of electricity which is equivalent to that of mechanical energy. This additional element will not create a right to issue guarantees of origin in accordance with Article 14(10). (d) Member States may use other reporting periods than one year for the purpose of the calculations according to points (b) and (c) of this Annex. (e) For micro-cogeneration units the calculation of primary energy savings may be based on certified data. (f) Efficiency reference values for separate production of heat and electricity The harmonised efficiency reference values shall consist of a matrix of values differentiated by relevant factors, including year of construction and types of fuel, and must be based on a well-documented analysis taking, inter alia, into account data from operational use under realistic conditions, fuel mix and climate conditions as well as applied cogeneration technologies. The efficiency reference values for separate production of heat and electricity in accordance with the formula set out in point (b) shall establish the operating efficiency of the separate heat and electricity production that cogeneration is intended to substitute. The efficiency reference values shall be calculated according to the following principles: 1. For cogeneration units the comparison with separate electricity production shall be based on the principle that the same fuel categories are compared. 2. Each cogeneration unit shall be compared with the best available and economically justifiable technology for separate production of heat and electricity on the market in the year of construction of the cogeneration unit. 3. The efficiency reference values for cogeneration units older than 10 years of age shall be fixed on the reference values of units of 10 years of age. 4.

Methods for calculating energy savings for the purposes of Article 7(1) and (2), and points (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the second subparagraph of Article 7(9), and Article 20(6). Obligated, participating or entrusted parties, or implementing public authorities may use one or more of the following methods for calculating energy savings: (a) deemed savings, by reference to the results of previous independently monitored energy improvements in similar installations. The generic approach is termed \u2018ex-ante\u2019; (b) metered savings, whereby the savings from the installation of a measure, or package of measures, is determined by recording the actual reduction in energy use, taking due account of factors such as additionality, occupancy, production levels and the weather which may affect consumption. The generic approach is termed \u2018ex-post\u2019; (c) scaled savings, whereby engineering estimates of savings are used. This approach may only be used where establishing robust measured data for a specific installation is difficult or disproportionately expensive, e.g. replacing a compressor or electric motor with a different kWh rating than that for which independent information on savings has been measured, or where they are carried out on the basis of nationally established methodologies and benchmarks by qualified or accredited experts that are independent of the obligated, partici\u00ad pating or entrusted parties involved; (d) surveyed savings, where consumers\u2019 response to advice, information campaigns, labelling or certification schemes, or smart metering is determined. This approach may only be used for savings resulting from changes in consumer behaviour. It may not be used for savings resulting from the installation of physical measures. 2. In determining the energy saving for an energy efficiency measure for the purposes of Article 7(1) and (2), and points (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the second subparagraph of Article 7(9), and Article 20(6) the following principles shall apply: (a) credit may only be given for savings exceeding the following levels: (i) Union emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles following the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community\u2019s integrated approach to reduce CO 2 emissions from light-duty vehicles ( 1 ) and Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Union\u2019s integrated approach to reduce CO 2 emissions from light-duty vehicles ( 2 ), respectively; (ii) Union requirements relating to the removal from the market of certain energy related products following the implementation of implementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC; and (b) to account for climatic variations between regions, Member States may choose to adjust the savings to a standard value or to accord different energy savings in accordance with the temperature variations between regions; ( 1) OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 1.

This may be done by counting the savings each individual action will achieve between its implementation date and 31 December 2020. Alternatively, Member States may adopt another method that is estimated to achieve at least the same total quantity of savings. When using other methods, Member States shall ensure that the total amount of energy savings calculated with these other methods does not exceed the amount of energy savings that would have been the result of their calculation when counting the savings each individual action will achieve between its implementation date and 31 December 2020.

Where such standards do not exist, Member States shall work with obligated, participating or entrusted parties to introduce them. 3. In determining the energy saving from policy measures applied under point (a) of the second subparagraph of Article 7(9), the following principles shall apply: (a) credit shall only be given for energy savings from taxation measures exceeding the minimum levels of taxation applicable to fuels as required in Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity ( 1) or in Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax ( 2) ; (b) recent and representative official data on price elasticities shall be used for calculation of the impact; and (c) the energy savings from accompanying taxation policy instruments, including fiscal incentives or payment to a fund, shall be accounted separately. 4.

The cost-benefit analysis may either cover a project assessment or a group of projects for a broader local, regional or national assessment in order to establish the most cost-effective and beneficial heating or cooling option for a given geographical area for the purpose of heat planning. Cost-benefit analyses for the purposes of Article 14(3) shall include an economic analysis covering socio-economic and environmental factors. The cost-benefit analyses shall include the following steps and considerations: (a) Establishing a system boundary and geographical boundary The scope of the cost-benefit analyses in question determines the relevant energy system. The geographical boundary shall cover a suitable well-defined geographical area, e.g. a given region or metropolitan area, to avoid selecting sub- optimised solutions on a project by project basis. (b) Integrated approach to demand and supply options The cost-benefit analysis shall take into account all relevant supply resources available within the system and geographical boundary, using the data available, including waste heat from electricity generation and industrial installations and renewable energy, and the characteristics of, and trends in heat and cooling demand. (c) Constructing a baseline The purpose of the baseline is to serve as a reference point, to which the alternative scenarios are evaluated. (d) Identifying alternative scenarios All relevant alternatives to the baseline shall be considered. Scenarios that are not feasible due to technical reasons, financial reasons, national regulation or time constraints may be excluded at an early stage of the cost-benefit analysis if justified based on careful, explicit and well-documented", "embedding_index": 35}, {"chunk_id": "62013b61-45c0-4f00-8687-41b7d4bbeb01_36", "text": " the characteristics of, and trends in heat and cooling demand. (c) Constructing a baseline The purpose of the baseline is to serve as a reference point, to which the alternative scenarios are evaluated. (d) Identifying alternative scenarios All relevant alternatives to the baseline shall be considered. Scenarios that are not feasible due to technical reasons, financial reasons, national regulation or time constraints may be excluded at an early stage of the cost-benefit analysis if justified based on careful, explicit and well-documented considerations. Only high-efficiency cogeneration, efficient district heating and cooling or efficient individual heating and cooling supply options should be taken into account in the cost-benefit analysis as alternative scenarios compared to the baseline. (e) Method for the calculation of cost-benefit surplus (i) The total long-term costs and benefits of heat or cooling supply options shall be assessed and compared. (ii) The criterion for evaluation shall be the net present value (NPV) criterion. (iii) The time horizon shall be chosen such that all relevant costs and benefits of the scenarios are included. For example, for a gas-fired power plant an appropriate time horizon could be 25 years, for a district heating system, 30 years, or for heating equipment such as boilers 20 years.

(iv) The prices used in the economic analysis shall reflect the true socio economic costs and benefits and should include external costs, such as environmental and health effects, to the extent possible, i.e. when a market price exists or when it is already included in European or national regulation. (g) Economic analysis: Inventory of effects The economic analyses shall take into account all relevant economic effects. Member States may assess and take into account in decision making costs and energy savings from the increased flexibility in energy supply and from a more optimal operation of the electricity networks, including avoided costs and savings from reduced infrastructure investment, in the analysed scenarios.
