(2) The Product Environmental Footprint and Organisation Environmental Footprint methods (hereafter \u2018Environmental Footprint methods\u2019) enable companies to measure and communicate their environmental performance and thereby compete on the market based on reliable environmental information. They contain detailed instructions on how to model and calculate the environmental impacts of products and organisations. The Environmental Footprint methods build on existing, internationally accepted practices, indicators and rules. (3) In 2013, the Commission adopted Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU(1)to promote the use of common methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations. It recommends their use to Member States, companies, private organisations and the financial community, and contains two annexes establishing the proposed methods. (4) The Commission established a framework for developing further the Environmental Footprint methods with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders, including industry, and particularly SMEs, through a pilot phase. (5) In the pilot phase running from 2013 to 2018, the development of product-specific rules (Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules, PEFCRs) and sector-specific rules (Organisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rules, OEFSRs) was tested with the active participation of stakeholders, resulting in the finalisation of 19 PEFCRs and 2 OEFSRs. (6) The Environmental Footprint methods were also updated on several technical aspects, such as: (1) application of the materiality principle (\u2018act where it matters\u2019); (2) the definition of a benchmark corresponding to the Environmental Footprint profile of the average production the market, also called representative product / organisation; (3) agreements on the modelling of key aspects concerning climate change, electricity, transport, infrastructure & equipment, packaging, end-of-life and agriculture; (4) inclusion of normalisation and weighting; (5) guidelines on how to include biodiversity as additional environmental information; (6) improvement of some impact assessment (1) Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU of 9 April 2013 on the use of common methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations (OJ L 124, 4.5.2013, p. 1).\n\nL 471/2 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.12.2021 methods, with particular attention to the toxicity-related methods (human toxicity \u2013 cancer effects; human toxicity \u2013 non-cancer effects; eco-toxicity freshwater, water use, land use, resources and particulate matter); (7) defining characterisation factors based on REACH data; (8) and a guide on Environmental Footprint compliant datasets. (7) The results of the pilot phase were presented in the 2019 Commission Staff Working Document on \u2018Sustainable Products in a Circular Economy \u2013 Towards an EU Product Policy Framework contribution to the Circular Economy\u2019(2). The same staff working document also indicated possible uses of the Environmental Footprint methods in policy development at EU level. Since 2019, and following a call of interest addressed to industry, the Commission continued the development of new Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules. (8) The Council Conclusions of October 2019(3) welcomed the piloting of the EU Environmental Footprint methodology and all initiatives to support the communication of environmental impacts based on the Environmental Footprint pilot. (9) The European Green Deal(4) aims to mobilise industries for a clean and circular economy and underlines that to enable buyers to make more sustainable decisions and reduce the risk of \u2018green washing\u2019, reliable, comparable and verifiable information is needed. (10) In its Communication \u2018A new Circular Economy Action Plan \u2013 For a cleaner and more competitive Europe\u2019(5), the Commission highlighted that companies should substantiate their environmental claims using Product and Organisation Environmental Footprint methods and committed to test the integration of these methods in the EU Ecolabel. (11) The Communication on a \u2018New Consumer Agenda \u2013 Strengthening consumer resilience for sustainable recovery\u2019(6) indicates that to stimulate more voluntary corporate action, the Commission plans to work with economic operators to encourage their voluntary pledges to disclose to consumers the company\u2019s environmental footprint, improve their sustainability and reduce the impact on the environment", "embedding_index": 0}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_1", "text": " Commission highlighted that companies should substantiate their environmental claims using Product and Organisation Environmental Footprint methods and committed to test the integration of these methods in the EU Ecolabel.

(12) The Council Conclusions of December 2020 noted that the Product Environmental Footprint method has the potential of being one underlying methodology for various product policy tools in the EU and the framework for sustainable products, taking also other suitable methodologies into account. (13) The use of the Environmental Footprint methods is already foreseen in the context of EU policies and legislation such as the Taxonomy Regulation(7), the Sustainable Batteries Initiative(8)and the Green Consumption Pledge(9). (14) In the light of these developments, Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU should be updated to integrate the technical developments of the pilot phase, in particular the development of category and sector rules, and therefore provide a sound basis for further policy development and implementation. It should facilitate companies to calculate their environmental performance based on reliable, verifiable and comparable information, and for other actors (public administrations, NGOs, business partners, for example) to have access to such information. It should also enhance the development of an EU Environmental Footprint database. (15) SMEs might lack the expertise and resources to address the requests for life cycle environmental performance information. Therefore, support to SMEs should be provided not only by the Commission, but also by Member States and industrial associations. (2) SWD(2019) 91final.

These aspects are discussed in the Commission expert group on the Environmental Footprint Technical Advisory Board. Impacts related to biodiversity are for instance currently being considered. (17) As announced in the new Circular Economy Action Plan, the Commission will explore the development of a regulatory framework for certification of carbon removals based on robust and transparent carbon accounting to monitor and verify the authenticity of carbon removals. This framework will be developed in mutual synergy and consistency with the environmental footprint method and when necessary be reflected in future updates of this Recommendation. (18) While this recommendation focuses on environmental impacts, in the global context concerns related to economic and social impacts, including of labour practices, play an increasingly important role. The Commission will continue to closely follow these developments as well as methods of analysing environmental, social and economic supply chain impacts of products consumed in the EU that have effects along the supply chain in third countries.

Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs) The primary objective of a PEFCR is to fix a consistent and specific set of rules for calculating the relevant environmental information of products belonging to the product category in scope. An important objective is to focus on what matters most for a specific product category,to make PEF studies easier, faster and less costly. An equally important objective is to enable comparisons and comparative assertions in all cases where this is feasible, relevant and appropriate. Comparisons and comparative assertions are allowed only if PEF studies are conducted in compliance with a PEFCR. AllPEF studiesshall be conducted in compliance with a PEFCR, if a PEFCR is available for the product in scope. Requirements for developing PEFCRs are specified in part A of Annex II. A PEFCR may further specify requirements made in the PEF method and add new requirements, ifthe PEF method leaves more than one choice. The objective is to ensure that PEFCRs are developed according to the PEF method and that they provide the specifications needed to achieve the comparability, increased reproducibility, consistency", "embedding_index": 14}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_15", "text": " with a PEFCR, if a PEFCR is available for the product in scope. Requirements for developing PEFCRs are specified in part A of Annex II. A PEFCR may further specify requirements made in the PEF method and add new requirements, ifthe PEF method leaves more than one choice. The objective is to ensure that PEFCRs are developed according to the PEF method and that they provide the specifications needed to achieve the comparability, increased reproducibility, consistency, relevance, focus and efficiency of PEF studies. PEFCRs should, as far as possible, and recognising the different application contexts, be compliant with existing relevant international product category rules (PCR). If other PCRs are available from other schemes, these are to be listed and evaluated. They may be used as a basis for developing a PEFCR, in line with the requirements provided in Annex II. 1.1.Approach and examples for potential applications The rules provided in the PEF method enable practitioners to conduct PEF studies that are more reproducible, consistent, robust, verifiable and comparable. The results of PEF studies are the basis for the provision of EF information and they may be used ina diverse number of potential fields of application. Applications of PEF studies without an existing PEFCR for the product(s) in scope will include: 1) In-house applications a) optimising processes along the life cycle of a product, b) supportingenvironmental management, c) identifying environmental hotspots, d) supportingproduct design that minimisesenvironmental impacts along the life cycle, e) environmental performance improvement and tracking, 2) External applications: (e.g. business to business (B2B), business to consumer (B2C)): a) applying or complying with policies referring to the PEF, b) responding to customers and consumers demands, c) marketing, d) co-operation along supply chains to optimise the product along the life cycle, e) participating in 3rd party schemes related to environmental claims or giving visibility to products that calculate and communicate their life cycle environmental performance. Applications of PEF studies performed in compliance with an existing PEFCR for the product in scope, in addition to those listed above, will include: \u2022 Comparisons and comparative assertions (i.e. claims of overall superiority or equivalence for the environmental performance of one product compared to another (based on EN ISO 14040:2006)) based on PEF studies, \u2022 Comparison and comparative assertions against the benchmark of the product category, followed by a grading of other products according to their performance versus the benchmark, \u2022 Identifying significant environmental impacts common to a product group, \u2022 Reputational schemes giving visibility to products that calculate their life cycle environmental performance,\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/221 \u2022 Green procurement (public and corporate).\n\nL 471/222 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 2. General considerations for Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) studies 2.1.How to use this method This method provides the rules necessary to conduct a PEF study and is presented in a sequential manner, in the order of the methodological steps that shall be completed when calculating a PEF. Where appropriate, sections begin with a general description of the methodological step, along with an overview of necessary considerations and supporting examples. When additional requirements for creating PEFCRs are specified, these are available in Annex II. 2.2.Principles for Product Environmental Footprint studies To perform a PEF study the following two requirements shall be met: i) The bill of material (BoM) shall be specific of the product in scope, ii) The modelling of the manufacturing processes shall be based on company-specific data (e.g. energy needed toassemblethe materials/components of the product in scope). Note: For companies producing more than one product,the activity data used (including the BoM) shall be specific to the product in scope of the study. To produce reliable, reproducible, and verifiable PEF studies, a core suite of analytical principles shall be adhered to. These principles provide overarching guidance onhow toapplythe PEF method. They shall be considered with respect to each phase of PEF studies, from defining the goal and the scope, through data collection, impact assessment, reporting and verification of study outcomes. Users of this method shall observe the following principles in conducting a PEF study: (1) Relevance All methods used and data collected for the purpose of quantifying the PEF shall be as relevant to the study as possible. (2) Completeness Quantification of the PEF shall include all environmentally relevant material/energy flows and other environmental interventions as required for adherence to the defined system boundary, the data requirements, and the", "embedding_index": 15}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_16", "text": " through data collection, impact assessment, reporting and verification of study outcomes.

(2) Completeness Quantification of the PEF shall include all environmentally relevant material/energy flows and other environmental interventions as required for adherence to the defined system boundary, the data requirements, and the impact assessment methods employed.

(4) Accuracy All reasonable effort shall be taken to reduce uncertainties in product system modelling and the reporting of results. (5) Transparency PEF information shall be disclosed in such a way as to provide intended users with the necessary basis for decision- making, and for stakeholders to assess its robustness and reliability. 2.3.Phases of a Product Environmental Footprint study A number of phases shall be completed in carrying out a PEF study in line with this method -i.e. goal definition, scope definition, life cycle inventory(LCI), life cycle impact assessment(LCIA), interpretation of PEF results and PEF reporting \u2013see Figure 2.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/223 Figure 2Phases of a Product Environmental Footprint study Define the goal and scope of the Product Environmental Footprint study Compile the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) EF Verification Conduct Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) Life Cycle Interpretation and EF reporting In the goal definitionphase, the aims of the study are defined, namely the intended application, the reasons for carrying out the study and the intended audience. In the scope definition phase, the main methodological choices are made, for example the exact definition of the functional unit, identifying the system boundary, selecting additional environmental and technical information, and the main assumptions and limitations. The LCI phase involves the data collectionprocedureand the calculation procedure for quantifying of inputs and outputs of the studied system. Inputs and outputs concern energy, raw material and other physical inputs, products and co-products and waste, and emissions to air/water/soil. Data collected concern foreground processes and background processes. Data are put in relationship to the process units and functional unit. The LCI is an iterative process. In fact, as data are collected and more is learned about the system, new data requirements or limitations may be identified that require a change in the data collection procedures so the goals of the study will still be met. In the impact assessment phase, LCI results are associated withenvironmental impact categories and indicators. This is done throughLCIA methods, which first classify emissions into impact categories and then characterise them ascommon units (e.g. CO and CH emissions are both expressed in CO equivalent emissions by using their 2 4 2 global warming potential). Examples of impact categories are climate change, acidification or resource use. In the interpretation phase, results from LCI and LCIA are interpreted in accordance withthe stated goal and scope. In this phase, most relevant impact categories, life cycle stages, processes and elementary flows are identified. Conclusions and recommendations can be drawn, based on the analytical results. It alsoincludes the reporting step designed to summarise the results of the PEF study in the PEF report. Finally, during the verification phase a conformity assessment process is carried out,to check whether the PEF study has been carried out in compliance with the present PEF method. The verification is mandatory whenever the PEF study, or part of the information init, is used for any type of external communication.\n\nL 471/224 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 3. Defining the goal(s) and scope of the Product Environmental Footprint study 3.1.Goal definition Goal definition is the first step of a PEF study, and sets the overall context for the study. The purpose of clearly defining goals is to ensure that the aims, methods, results and intended applications are aligned, and that a shared vision is in place to guide participants in the study. The decision to use the PEF method implies that some aspects of the goal definition will be decided a priori, due to the specific requirements provided by the PEF method. In defining goals, it is important to identify the intended applications and the degree of analytical depth and rigour of the study. This shall be reflected in the defined study limitations (scope definition phase). The goal definition for a PEF study shall include: 1. Intended application(s); 2. Reasons for carrying out the study and decision context; 3. Target audience; 4.

The functional unit qualitatively and quantitatively describes the function(s) and duration of the product in scope. The reference flow is the amount of products needed to provide the defined function. All other input and output flows in the analysis quantitatively relate to it. The number of products needed to fulfil the lifetime of the product should always be rounded up, unless there is a valid reason for not doing this.The reference flow may be expressed in direct relation to the FU or in a more product-oriented way. Users of the PEF method shall define the FU and the reference flow for the PEF study. They shall alsodescribe which aspects of the product are not covered by the FU and justify why (e.g., because they are not quantifiable or intrinsically subjective). The FU for a PEF study shall be defined according to the following aspects: i) The function(s)/service(s) provided: \u2018what\u2019; ii) The extent of the function or service: \u2018how much\u2019; iii) The expected level of quality: \u2018how well\u2019; iv) The duration/life time of the product: \u2018how long\u2019; If shelf-life (indicated for example as \u2018best before date\u2019or \u2018use by date\u2019) is provided on the packaging (e.g. number of months)of food products,then food losses at storage, retail, and consumer stages shall be quantified. Ifthe type of packaging affects the shelf-life, it shall be taken into account.This is relevant for the \u2018how long\u2019aspect of the FU. Ifapplicable standards exist, they shall be used and cited in the PEF study when defining the FU. The International System of Units (SI), commonly known as the metric system, shall always be used. Example 1 Define the FU of decorative paint: the functional unit is to protect and decorate 1 m2of substrate for 50 years at a specified quality level (minimum 98% opacity). What: Provide decoration and protection of a substrate, How much:coverage of 1 m2of substrate, How well:with a minimum 98% opacity How long:for 50 years (life time of the building) Reference flow:amount of product needed to fulfil the defined function,tobe measured in kg of paint. Example 2 Define the FU and reference flow for the PEF of pet food. What: To serve the recommended daily intake in kilocalories of metabolisable energy (kcal ME) (\u2018daily ration\u2018) of prepared pet food to a cat or dog How much: Daily ration How well:To meet the daily caloric and nutritional requirements of an average cat or dog (where average refers to the pet\u2019sweight: 4 kg for a cat and 15 kg for a dog) How long:1 day of serving prepared pet food to a cat or dog. Reference flow:amount of product needed to fulfil the defined function,tobe measured in grams (g) per day. For intermediate products, the FU is more difficult to define as it may often fulfil multiple functions and the whole", "embedding_index": 17}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_18", "text": ":To meet the daily caloric and nutritional requirements of an average cat or dog (where average refers to the pet\u2019sweight: 4 kg for a cat and 15 kg for a dog) How long:1 day of serving prepared pet food to a cat or dog. Reference flow:amount of product needed to fulfil the defined function,tobe measured in grams (g) per day. For intermediate products, the FU is more difficult to define as it may often fulfil multiple functions and the whole life cycle of the product is not known. Therefore, a declared unit should be applied, for example, mass (kilograms) or volume (cubic meters). In this case, the reference flow may correspond to the FU.\n\nL 471/226 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 3.2.2. System boundary The system boundary defines which parts of the product life cycle and which associated life cycle stages and processes belong to the analysed system (i.e. are required for carrying outits function as defined by the FU), except for those processes excluded based on the cut-off rule (see section 4.6.4). The reason for and potential significance of any exclusion shall be justified and documented. The system boundary shall be defined following a general supply-chain logic, including all stages from raw material acquisition and pre-processing, production of the main product, product distribution and storage, use stage and end of life treatment of the product (if appropriate, see section 4.2). The co-products, by-products and waste streams of at least the foreground system shall be clearly identified. System boundary diagram A system boundary diagram (or flow diagram) is a schematic representation of the analysed system. It shall clearly indicate the activities or processes that are included andthose that are excluded from the analysis. The user of the PEF method shall highlight where company-specific data were used. The activity and/or process names in the system diagram and in the PEF report shall be aligned. The system diagram shall be included in the scope definition and included in the PEF report. 3.2.3. Environmental Footprint impact categories The purpose of LCIA is to group and aggregate the collected LCI data according to the respective contributions to each EF impact category. The selection of EF impact categories covers a broad range of relevant environmental issues related to the product supply chain of interest, following the general completeness requirements for PEF studies. EF impact categories13refer to specific categories of impacts considered in a PEF study and they constitute the EF impact assessment method. Characterisation models are used to quantify the environmental mechanism between the LCI (i.e. inputs (e.g. resources) and emissions associated with the product life cycle) and the category indicator of each EF impact category. Table 2provides a default list of EF impact categories and related assessment methods.For a PEF study, all EF impact categories shall be applied, without exclusion.

Additional information to be included in the PEF Relevant potential environmental impacts of a product may go beyond the EF impact categories. It is important to report them, whenever feasible, as additional environmental information. Similarly, relevant technical aspects and/or physical properties of the product in scope may need to be taken into account. These aspects shall be reported as additional technical information. 3.2.4.1.

The supportingmodels forthis additional information shall be clearly referenced and documented together with the corresponding indicators. For example, biodiversity impacts due to land use changes may occur in association with a specific site or activity. This may require the application of additional impact categories that are not included among the EF impact categories, or even additional qualitative descriptions,where impacts may not be linked to the product supply chain in a quantitative manner. Such additional methods should be viewed as complementary to the EF impact categories. Additional environmental information shall only be related to environmental aspects. Information and instructions, e.g.product safety sheets that are not related to the environmental performance of the product, shall not be part of additional environmental information. Additional environmental information may include: (a) Information on local/site-specific impacts; (b) Offsets; (c) Environmental indicators or product responsibility indicators (e.g. as per the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)); (d) For gate-to-gate assessments, number of IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk; (e) Description of significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity in protected areas and in areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas; (f) Noise impacts; (g) Other environmental information considered relevant within the scope of the PEF study. Biodiversity The PEF method does not include any impact category named \u2018biodiversity\u2018, as currently there is no international consensus on an LCIA method capturing that impact. However, the PEF method includes at least eight impact categories that have an effect on biodiversity (i.e., climate change, eutrophication (aquatic freshwater), 18 In the EF flow list, and for the current recommendation, Uranium is included in the list of energy carriers, and it is measured in MJ. 19 The UCPD and related guidance is available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Al32011\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/229 eutrophication (aquatic marine), eutrophication (terrestrial), acidification, water use, land use, ecotoxicity freshwater). Considering the high relevance of biodiversity for many product groups, each PEF study shall explain whether biodiversity is relevant for the product in scope. If that is the case, the user of the PEF method shall include biodiversity indicators under additional environmental information. The following options may be used to cover biodiversity: (a) expressingthe (avoided) impact on biodiversity as the percentage of material that comes from ecosystems that have been managed to maintain or enhance conditions for biodiversity, as demonstrated by regular monitoring and reporting of biodiversity levels and gains or losses (e.g. less than 15% loss of species richness due to disturbance\u2013 thoughthe PEF studies may set their own loss level,ifthey can make a convincing case for it and not in contradiction to a relevant existing PEFCR). The assessment should refer to materials that end up in the final products and to materials that havebeen used during the production process. For example, charcoal that is used in steel production processes, or soy that is used to feed cows that produce dairy etc. (b) To report, additionally, the percentage of such materials for which no chain of custody or traceability information can be found. (c) To use a certification system as a proxy. The user of the PEF method should determine which certification schemes provide sufficient evidence for ensuring biodiversity maintenance and describe the criteria used. The user of the PEF method may choose other, relevant indicators to cover the impacts of the product on biodiversity. The PEF study shall motivate the choice and describe the chosen methodology. 3.2.4.2.

Life cycle inventory An inventory of all material, energy and waste inputs and outputs and emissions into air, water and soil for the product supply chain shall be compiled as a basis for modelling the PEF. Detailed data requirements and quality requirements are described in section4.6. The life cycle inventory (LCI) shall adopt the following classification of flows included: 1) elementary flows; 2) non-elementary (or complex) flows(e.g. product or waste flows). Within the PEF study, all non-elementary flows in the LCI shall be modelled up to the level of elementary flows, apart from the product flow forthe product in scope. For example, waste flows shall not only be included in the study as kg of household waste or hazardous waste, but shall be modelled up to the stage of emissions into water, air and soil,fromthe treatment ofthe solid waste. The LCI modelling is therefore only complete when all non- elementary flows are expressed as elementary flows. Therefore, the LCI dataset of the PEF study shall contain only elementary flows, apart from the product flow forthe product in scope. 4.1. Screening step An initial screening of the LCI\u2013the \u2018screening step\u2019\u2013may be performed because it helps focus data collection activities and data quality priorities. A screening step shall include the LCIA phase and result in further, iterative refinements to the life cycle model for the product in scope, as more information becomes available. Within a screening step,no cut-off is allowed and readily available primary or secondary data may be used, fulfilling the data quality requirements to the extent possible (as defined in section 4.6). Once the screening is performed, the initial scope settings may be refined. 4.2 Life cycle stages As a minimum, the default life cycle stages in a PEF study shall be: 1) raw material acquisition and pre-processing (including production of parts and components); 2) manufacturing (production of the main product); 3) distribution (product distribution and storage); 4) use; 5) end of life (including product recovery or recycling). Ifa different name is used for anyofthesedefault stages, the user shall specify which default stage it corresponds to. If there is valid need to do so, the user of the PEF method may decide to split or add life cycle stages. The reason(s) for doing thisshall be set out in the PEF report. For example, the life cycle stage 'Raw material acquisition and pre-processing' may be split into 'Raw material acquisition', 'pre-processing', and 'raw materials supplier transport'. For intermediate products, the following life cycle stages shall be excluded: 1) distribution (justified exceptions are allowed); 2) use; 3) end of life (including product, recovery / recycling) ", "embedding_index": 21}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_22", "text": " life cycle stages.

For intermediate products, the following life cycle stages shall be excluded: 1) distribution (justified exceptions are allowed); 2) use; 3) end of life (including product, recovery / recycling) 4.2.1. Raw material acquisition and pre-processing This life cycle stage starts when resources are extracted from nature,and ends when product components enter (through the gate of) the product\u2019s production facility. Examples of processes that may occur in this stage include: 1) mining and extraction of resources; 2) pre-processing of all material inputs to the productin scope, including recyclable materials; 3) agricultural and forestry activities; 4) transportation within and between extraction and pre-processing facilities, and to the production facility.\n\nL 471/232 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 Packaging production shall be modelled as part of the \u2018Raw material acquisition and pre-processing\u2019 life cycle stage. 4.2.2. Manufacturing The production stage begins when the product components enter the production site,and ends when the finished product leaves the production facility. Examples of production-related activities include: 1) chemical processing; 2) manufacturing; 3) transport of semi-finished products between manufacturing processes; 4) assembly of material components. The waste ofproducts used during manufacturing shall be included in the modelling forthe manufacturing stage. The circular footprint formula(section 4.4.8) shall be applied to such waste. 4.2.3. Distribution Products are distributed to users and may be stored at various points along the supply chain. The distribution stage includes transport from factory gate to warehouse/retail, storage at warehouse/retail and transport from warehouse/retail to consumer home. Examples of processes to include: 1) energy inputs for warehouse lighting and heating; 2) use of refrigerants in warehouses and transport vehicles; 3) fuel use by vehicles; 4) roads and trucks. Waste fromproducts used during distribution and storage shall be included in the modelling. The circular footprint formula(section 4.4.8) shall be applied to such waste,and theresults taken into consideration under the distribution stage. Default loss rates per type of product during distribution and at the consumer are provided in part F of Annex II and shall be used ifno specific information isavailable. Allocation rules on energy consumption at storage are presented in section 4.4.5. For transport,see section 4.4.3. 4.2.4. Use The use stage describes how the product is expected to be used by the end user (e.g. the consumer). Thisstage starts the moment the end user uses the product until it leaves its place of use and enters the end of life (EoL) stage (e.g., recycling or final treatment). The use stage includes all activities and products that are needed for proper use of the product (i.e. to ensure it performs its original function throughout its lifetime). Waste generated by usingthe product, such as food waste and its primary packaging or the product itself once no longer functional, is excluded from the use stage and shall be part of the EoL stage of the product. Some examples include: the provision of tap water when cooking pasta; the manufacturinganddistribution of, and waste from, materials needed for maintenance, repair or refurbishment (e.g. spare parts needed to repair the product, coolant production and waste management due to losses). The EoL of coffee capsules, residues for coffee making and packaging of ground coffee belong to the end of life stage. In some cases, some products are needed for a proper use of the product in scope and they are used in a way that they become physically integrated: in this case, the waste treatment of these products belongs to the EoL of the product in scope. For example, when the product in scope is a detergent, the treatment of the wastewater following theuse of the detergent belongs to the end of life stage. The use scenario also needs to reflect whether or not the use of the analysed products might lead to changes in the systems in which they are used. The following sources of technical information on the use scenario may be taken into account: 1) Market surveys or other market data;\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/233 2) Published international standards that specify guidance and requirements for developing scenarios for the use stage and scenarios for (i.e. estimation of) the service life of the product; 3)", "embedding_index": 22}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_23", "text": " in the systems in which they are used.

The manufacturer\u2019s recommended method to be applied in the use stage (e.g. cooking in an oven at a specified temperature for a specified time) should beused to provide a basis for determining the use stage of a product. The actual usage pattern may, however, differ from those recommended and should be used if this information is available and documented. Default loss rates per type of product during distribution and at consumer are provided inpart F of Annex IIand shall be used ifno specific information isavailable. The following processes are excluded from the use stage: 1) If a product is reused (see also section 4.4.9.2), the processes needed to collect the product and make it ready for the new use cycle are excluded (e.g. the impacts from collection and cleaning reusable bottles). These processes are included in the EoL stage, if the product is reused as a product with different specifications (see section 4.4.9 for further details). If the product lifetime is extended to that of a product with original product specifications (providing the same function),these processes shall be included in the FU and reference flow. 2) Transport from retail to consumer home shall be excluded from the use stage and shall instead be included in the distribution stage. 3) The transport to EoL shall be excluded from the use stage and instead be included in the end of life stage. Waste fromproducts used during the use stage shall be included in the modelling forthe use stage. The circular footprint formula (section 4.4.8) shall be applied to such waste. The PEF report shall document themethods and assumptions used for this stage. All relevant assumptions for the use stage shall be documented. Technical specifications formodellingthe use stage are available in Section 4.4.7. 4.2.5. End of life (including product recovery and recycling) The end of life stage begins when the product in scope and its packaging is discarded by the user and ends when the productin scope is returned to nature as a waste product or enters another product\u2019s life cycle (i.e. as a recycled input). In general thisincludes the waste fromthe product in scope, such as food waste and primary packaging. Wastegenerated during the manufacturing, distribution, retail, use stage or after use shall be included in the life cycle of the product and modelled at the life cycle stage where it occurs. The end of life stage shall be modelled using the circular footprint formula and requirements provided in section 4.4.8. The user of the PEF method shall include all EoL processes applicable to the product in scope. Examples of processes to be covered in this life cycle stage include: 1) Collection and transport of the product in scope and its packaging to end of life treatment facilities; 2) Dismantling of components; 3) Shredding and sorting; 4) Wastewater fromproducts used, dissolved in or with water (e.g. detergents, shower gels, etc.); 5) Conversion into recycled material; 6) Composting or other organic-wastetreatment methods; 7) Incineration and disposal of bottom ash; 8) Landfilling and landfill operation and maintenance.

Crop type specific and country, region or climate specific data Crop type specific and country/region/climate-specific data for yield, water and land use, land use change, fertiliser (artificial and organic) amount (N, P amount) and pesticide amount (per active ingredient), per hectare per year, shall be used. 4.4.1.3. Averaging data Cultivation data shall be collected over a period of time sufficient to provide an average assessment of the LCI associated with the inputs and outputs forcrop growingthat will offset fluctuations due to seasonal differences. This shall be undertaken as described in the LEAP guidelines, set out below: (a) For annual crops, an assessment period of at least three years shall be used (to level out differences in crop yields related to fluctuations in growing conditions over the years such as climate, pests and diseases, etc.). Where data covering a three-year period is not available,i.e. due to starting up 21 https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 22 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/EF 23 Environmental performance of animal feed supply chains (pages 36-43), FAO 2016, available at http://www.fao.org/partnerships/leap/publications/en/\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/235 a new production system (e.g. new greenhouse, newly cleared land, shift to other crop), the assessment may be conducted over a shorter period, but shall be not less than 1 year. Crops or plants grown in greenhouses shall be considered to beannual crops/ plants, unless the growthcycle is significantly less than a year and another crop is grown consecutively within that year. Tomatoes, peppers and other crops, which are grownand harvested over a longer period through the year,are considered to be annual crops. (b) For perennial plants (including entire plants and edible portions of perennial plants),a steady state situation (i.e. where all development stages are proportionally represented in the studied time period) shall be assumed and a three-year period shall be used to estimate the inputs and outputs. (c) Where the different stages in the growth cycle may be of differing durations, a correction shall be made by adjusting the crop areas allocated to different development stages,in proportion to the crop areas expected in a theoretical steady state. The application of such corrections shall be explained and recorded in the PEF report. The LCI of perennial plants and crops shall not be undertaken until the production system actually yields output. (d) For crops that are grown and harvested in less than one year (e.g. lettuce produced in 2 to 4 months) data shall be gathered in relation to the specific time period for production of a single crop, from at least three recent consecutive cycles. Averaging over three years may best be done by first gathering annual data and calculating the LCI per year and then determining the three-year average. 4.4.1.4. Pesticides Pesticide emissions shall be modelled as specific active ingredients. The USEtox life cycle impact assessment method has a built-in multimedia fate model which simulates the fate of the pesticides,starting from the different emission compartments.

Pesticides Pesticide emissions shall be modelled as specific active ingredients.

Therefore, default emission fractions to environmental emission compartments are needed in the LCI modelling. The pesticides applied to the field shall be modelled as 90% emitted to the agricultural soil compartment, 9% emitted to air and 1% emitted to water (based on expert judgement, due to current limitations). More specific data may be used if available. 4.4.1.5. Fertilisers Fertiliser (and manure) emissions shall be differentiated per fertiliser type and cover as a minimum: (a) NH, to air (from the use of N-fertiliser); 3 (b) NO, to air (direct and indirect) (from the use of N-fertiliser); 2 (c) CO, to air (from the use of lime, urea and urea-compounds); 2 (d) NO, to water unspecified (leaching from the use of N-fertiliser); 3 (e) PO, to water unspecified or freshwater (leaching and run-off of soluble phosphate from the use of P- 4 fertiliser); (f) P, to water unspecified or freshwater (soil particles containing phosphorous, from the use of P-fertiliser). The impact assessment model for freshwater eutrophication starts (i) when P leaves the agricultural field (run off) or (ii) from the application of manure or fertiliser on the agricultural field. Within LCI modelling, the agricultural field (soil) is often seen as belonging to the technosphere and thus included in the LCI model. This aligns with approach (i), where the impact assessment model starts after run-off, i.e. when P leaves the agricultural field. Therefore, within the EF context, the LCI should be modelled as the amount of P emitted to water after run-off and the emission compartment \u2018water\u2019 shall be used. When this amount is not available, the LCI may be modelled as the amount of P applied to the agricultural field (through manure or fertilisers) and the emission compartment \u2018soil\u2019 shall be used. In this case, the run-off from soil to water is part of the impact assessment method and included in the CF for soil. The impact assessment marine eutrophication starts after N leaves the field (soil). Therefore, N emissions to soil shall not be modelled. The amount of emissions ending up in the different air and water compartments per amount of fertilisers applied to the field shall be modelled within the LCI. N emissions shall be calculated from nitrogen applications bythe farmer tothe field and excluding external sources (e.g. rain deposition).

Thislast step serves to avoid fertility-depletion schemes by capturing the N-depletion by the analysed crop that is assumed to lead to the need for additional fertiliser later on and to keep the same soil fertility level.

Heavy metal emissions Heavy metal emissions from field inputs shall bemodelled as emission to soil and/or leaching or erosion to water. The inventory to water shall specify the oxidation state of the metal (e.g., Cr+3, Cr+6). As crops assimilate part of the heavy metal emissions during their cultivation,clarification is needed on how to model crops that act as a sink. Two different modelling approaches are allowed: (a) The final fate of the heavy metal elementary flows isnot further considered within the system boundary: the inventory does not account for the final emissions of the heavy metals and therefore shall not account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. For example, heavy metals in agricultural crops grown for human consumption end up in the plant. Within the EF context,human consumption is not modelled, the final fate is not further modelled and the plant acts as a heavy metal sink.

(b) The final fate (emission compartment) of the heavy metal elementary flows is considered within the system boundary: the inventory does account for the final emissions (release) of the heavy metals in the environment and therefore shall also account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. For example, heavy metals in agricultural cropsgrownfor feed will mainly end up in the animal digestion and used as manure back on the field where the metals are released in the environment and their impacts are captured by the impact assessment methods. Therefore, the inventory of the agricultural stage shall account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. A limited amount ends up in the animal, which may be neglected for simplification. 4.4.1.7 Rice cultivation Methane emissions from rice cultivation shall be included,based on the calculation rules insection5.5. of IPCC (2006) 4.4.1.8. Peat soils Drained peat soils shall include carbon dioxideemissions on the basis of a model that relates the drainage levels to annual carbon oxidation. 4.4.1.9. Other activities If applicable, the following activities shall be included in agricultural modelling, unless they are allowed to be excluded, based on the cut-off criteria: (a) input of seed material (kg/ha),\n\nL 471/238 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 (b) input of peat to soil (kg/ha + C/N ratio), (c) input of lime (kg CaCO/ha, type), 3 (d) machine use (hours,type) (to be included if there is high level of mechanisation), (e) input N from crop residues that stay on the field or are burned (kg residue + N content/ha). Including emissions from residue burning, drying and storage of products. Unless it is clearly documented that operations are carried out manually, field operationsshall be accounted for through total fuel consumption or through inputs of specific machinery, transports to/ from the field, energy for irrigation, or similar. 4.4.2. Electricity use Electricityusedfrom the grid shall be modelled as precisely as possible giving preference to supplier-specific data. If (part of) the electricity is renewable,it is important that no double counting occurs. Therefore, the supplier shall guarantee that the electricity supplied to the organisation to produce the product is effectively generated using renewable sources and is not available anymore for other consumers. 4.4.2.1. General guidelines The following section introduces two types of electricity mixes: (i) the consumption grid mix which reflects the total electricity mix transferred over a defined grid including green claimed or tracked electricity, and (ii) the residual grid mix, consumption mix (also named residual consumption mix), which characterizes the unclaimed, untracked or publicly shared electricity only. In PEF studies the following electricity mix shall be used, in hierarchical order: (a) Supplier-specific electricity product24shall be used if,for a country,there is a 100% tracking system in place, or if : (i) available, and (ii) the set of minimum criteria to ensure the contractual instruments are reliable is met. (b) The supplier-specific total electricity mix shall be used if: (i) available, and (ii) the set of minimum criteria to ensure the contractual instruments are reliable is met. (c) The \u2018country-specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019 shall be used. Country-specific means the country in which the life cycle stage or activity occurs. This may be an EU or non-EU country. The residual grid mix prevents double counting with the use of supplier-specific electricity mixes in (a) and (b). (d) As a last option, the average EU residual grid mix, consumption mix (EU+EFTA), or region representative residual grid mix, consumption mix, shall be used. The environmental integrity of the use of supplier-specific electricity mix depends on ensuring that contractual instruments (for tracking) are reliable and unique. Without this, the PEF lacks the accuracy and consistency needed to drive product/corporate electricity procurement decisions and accurate consideration of the supplier- specific mix by buyers of electricity. Therefore, a set of minimum criteria that relate to the integrity of the contractual instruments as reliable conveyers of environmental footprint information has", "embedding_index": 27}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_28", "text": " or region representative residual grid mix, consumption mix, shall be used.

Without this, the PEF lacks the accuracy and consistency needed to drive product/corporate electricity procurement decisions and accurate consideration of the supplier- specific mix by buyers of electricity. Therefore, a set of minimum criteria that relate to the integrity of the contractual instruments as reliable conveyers of environmental footprint information has been identified. They represent the minimum features necessary to use supplier-specific mix within PEF studies. 4.4.2.2. Set of minimum criteria to ensure contractual instruments from suppliers A supplier-specific electricity product/mix may only be used if the user of the PEF method ensures that the contractual instrument meets the criteria specified below. If contractual instruments do not meet the criteria, then the country-specific residual electricity consumption-mix shall be used in the modelling. 24 See EN ISO 14067:2018\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/239 The list of criteria below is based on the criteria of the \u2018GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance \u2013An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard\u2019(Mary Sotos, World Resource Institute)25. A contractual instrument used for electricity modelling shallmeet the following criteria. Criterion 1 \u2013conveyattributes Conveythe energy type mix associated with the unit of electricity produced. The energy type mix shall be calculated based on delivered electricity, incorporating certificates sourced and retired (obtained, acquired or withdrawn) on behalf of its customers. Electricity from facilities for which the attributes have been sold off (via contracts or certificates) shall be characterised as having the environmental attributes of the country residual consumption mix where the facility is located. Criterion 2 \u2013bea unique claim Be the only instrumentthat carriesthe environmental attribute claim associated with that quantity of electricity generated. Be tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled by or on behalf of the company (e.g. by an audit of contracts, third party certification, or handled automatically through other disclosure registries, systems, or mechanisms).

Explainthe calculation method used to determine this mix. Context Each programme or policy will establish their own eligibility criteria and the attributes to be conveyed. These criteria specify energy resource type and certain energy generation facility characteristics, such as type of technology, facility age, or facility location (but differ from one programme/policy to another). These attributes specify the energy resource type and sometimes some energy generation facility characteristics. Conditions 1. Convey the energy mix: if there is no energy type mix specified in the for satisfying contractual instruments, ask your supplier to provide you withthis information the criterion or other environmental attributes (e.g. GHG emission rate). If the supplier does not respond, use the \u2018country-specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019. If the supplier responds, go to step 2). 2. Explainthe calculation method used: ask your supplier to provide details of the calculation method to ensure that they follow the above principle. If your supplier does not provide this information, apply the supplier-specific electricity mix, include the information received and document that it was not possible to check for double counting. Criterion 2 UNIQUE CLAIMS Be the only instrument that carries the environmental attribute claim associated with that quantity of electricity generation. Be tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled by or on behalf of the company (e.g. by an audit of contracts, third party certification, or handled automatically through other disclosure registries,systems, or mechanisms). 25https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope%202%20Guidance_Final_Sept26.pdf\n\nL 471/240 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 Context Certificates generally serve four main purposes: (i) supplier disclosure, (ii) supplier quotas for the delivery or sales of specific energy sources, (iii) tax exemption, and (iv) voluntary consumer programmes.

Is the plant located in a country with a single certificate system or a multi- certificate system? If the plant is located in a region/country with a single certificate system the unique claim criteria is met. Use energy type mix mentioned on the contractual instrument. If the plant is located in a region/country with a multi-certificate system, the unique claim is not ensured. Contact the country-specific issuing body (The European organisation which governs the European Energy Certificate System, http://www.aib-net.org) to find out whether you need to ask for more than one contractual instrument(s)in order toensurethere is no risk of double counting. If more than one contractual instrument is needed, request all contractual instruments from the supplier to avoid double counting; If it is not possible to avoid double counting, report this in the PEF study and use the \u2018country-specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019. Criteria 3 Be issued and redeemed as close as possible to the period of electricity consumption to which the contractual instrument is applied. 4.4.2.3. How to model \u2018country-specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019 The user of the PEF method should identify suitable datasets for residual grid mix, consumption mix, eachenergy type, country and voltage. 26European Residual Mix | AIB (aib-net.org)\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/241 If no suitable dataset is available, the following approach should be used: determine the country consumption mix (e.g. X% of MWh produced with hydro energy, Y% of MWh produced with coal power plant) and combine them with LCI datasets per energy type and country/region (e.g. LCI dataset for the production of 1MWh hydro energy in Switzerland). 1) Activity data related to non-EU country consumption mix per detailed energy type shall be determined based on: (a) domesticproduction mix per production technology; (b) importquantity and from which neighbouring countries; (c) transmissionlosses; (d) distributionlosses; (e) typeof fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and/or domestic supply). These data should be found in International Energy Agency (IEA) publications. 2) Available LCI datasets per fuel technology; the LCI datasets available are generally specific to a country or a region in terms of: (a) fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and/ or domestic supply); (b) energy carrier properties (e.g.element and energy contents); (c) technology standards of power plants regarding efficiency, firing technology, flue-gas desulphurisation, NOx removal and de-dusting. 4.4.2.4. A single location with multiple products and more than one electricity mix This section describes how to proceed if only someof the electricity consumedis covered by a supplier-specific mix or on-site electricity generation and how toaccount for the electricity mix of products produced at the same location. In general, the subdivision of electricity supply used among multiple products is based on a physical relationship (e.g. number of pieces or kg of product). If the consumed electricity comes from more than one electricity mix, each mix source shall be used in terms of its proportionin the total kWh consumed. For example, if a fraction of this total kWh consumed comesfrom a specific supplier, a supplier-specific electricity mix shall be used for this amount. See Section4.4.2.7 for on-site electricity use. A specific type of electricity may be allocated to one specific product with the following conditions.

For example, if a fraction of this total kWh consumed comesfrom a specific supplier, a supplier-specific electricity mix shall be used for this amount. See Section4.4.2.7 for on-site electricity use. A specific type of electricity may be allocated to one specific product with the following conditions. (a) If the production (and the related electricity consumption) of a product occurs in a separate site (building), the energy type that is physically related to this site may be used. (b) If the production (and the related electricity consumption) of a product occurs in a space shared with specific energy metering or purchase records or electricity bills, the product-specific information (measure, record, bill) may be used. (c) If all the products produced in the specific plant are supplied with a publically available PEF study, the company that wantsto make the claimrelated to energy usedshall make all PEF studies available. The allocation rule applied shall be described in the PEF study, consistently applied in all PEF studies connected to the site and verified. An example is the 100% allocation of a greener electricity mix to a specific product. 4.4.2.5. For multiple locations producing one product In case a product is produced in different locations or sold in different countries, the electricity mix shall reflect the ratios of production or ratios of sales between EU countries/regions. To determine the ratio, a physical unit shall be used (e.g. number of pieces or kg of product). For PEF studies where such data are not available, the average EU residual consumption mix (EU+EFTA), or region-representative residual mix, shall be used. The same general guidelines mentioned above shall be applied. 4.4.2.6. Electricity use at the use stage During the use stage,the consumption grid mix shall be used. The electricity mix shall reflect the ratios of sales between EU countries/regions. To determine the ratio, a physical unit shall be used (e.g.number of pieces or kg of product). Where such data are not available, the average EU consumption mix (EU+EFTA), or region- representative consumption mix, shall be used.\n\nL 471/242 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 4.4.2.7 On-site electricity generation If on-site electricity production equalsthe site\u2019selectricity consumption, two situations apply: (a) nocontractual instruments have been sold to a third party: the user of the PEF method shall model its own electricity mix (combined with LCI datasets). (b) contractualinstruments have been sold to a third party: the user of the PEF method shall use \u2018country- specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019 (combined with LCI datasets). If the amount of electricity produced exceedsthe amount consumed on-site within the defined system boundary and is sold to, e.g.the electricity grid, this system may be seen as a multi-functionalsituation. The system will provide two functions (e.g. product + electricity) and the following rules shall be followed. (a) If possible, apply subdivision. This applies both to separate electricity productions or to a common electricity production where you may allocate, based on electricity amounts, the upstream and direct emissions to your own consumption and to the share you sell to a third party(e.g. if a company usesa windmill on itsproduction site and exports 30% of the produced electricity, emissions related to 70% of produced electricity should be accounted for in the PEF study). (b) If not possible, direct substitution shall be used. The country-specific residual consumption electricity mix shall be used as substitution27. Subdivision is not considered possible when upstream impacts or direct emissions are closely related to the product itself. 4.4.3. Transport and logistics The following parameters shall be taken into accountwhen modelling transport activities. (1) Transport type:thetype of transport, e.g. by land (truck, rail, pipe), water (boat, ferry, barge), or air (airplane). (2) Vehicle type:thetype of vehicle by transport type. (3) Loading rate (=utilisation ratio; see next section)28:environmentalimpacts are directly linked to the actual loading rate, which therefore shall be considered. The loading rate affects the vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption. (4) Number of empty returns:the number of empty returns (i.e.the ratio of the distance travelled to collect the next load after unloading the product to the distance travelled to transport the product), when applicable and relevant, shall be taken into account. The kilometres travelled by the empty vehicle shall beallocated to the product. In default transport datasets this is often already taken into account in the default utilisation ratio. (5", "embedding_index": 30}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_31", "text": " shall be considered. The loading rate affects the vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption. (4) Number of empty returns:the number of empty returns (i.e.the ratio of the distance travelled to collect the next load after unloading the product to the distance travelled to transport the product), when applicable and relevant, shall be taken into account. The kilometres travelled by the empty vehicle shall beallocated to the product. In default transport datasets this is often already taken into account in the default utilisation ratio. (5) Transport distance: transport distances shall be documented, applying average transport distances specific to the context being considered. Within the EF compliant datasets, the fuel production, the fuel consumption by the transport vehicle, the infrastructure needed and the amount of additional resources and tools needed for logistic operations (e.g.cranes and transporters) are included in the transport datasets. 4.4.3.1. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013truck transport EF compliant datasets for truck transport are per tkm (tonne*km) expressing the environmental impact for 1 tonne (t) of product that is transported for 1km in a truck with acertain load. The transport payload (=maximum mass allowed) is indicated in the dataset. For example, a truck of 28-32 t has a payload of 22 t; the LCA dataset for 1 tkm (fully loaded) expresses the environmental impact for 1 t of product that is transported for 1km within a 22 t loaded truck. The transport emissions are allocated based on the transported product\u2019s mass and you get only a share of 1/22 of thetruck\u2019sfull emissions.When the load transported is lower than the maximum load capacity (e.g. 10 t), the environmental impact for 1 t of product is affected in two ways. First, the truck has less fuel consumption per total load transported and second, its environmental impact is allocated by the load transported (e.g., 1/10 t). When a full freight\u2019s mass is lower than the truck\u2019s load capacity (e.g. 10 t), the transport of the 27 For some countries, this option is a best case rather than a worst case. 28 The loading rate is the ratio of actual load to the full load/ capacity (e.g. mass or volume) that a vehicle carries per trip.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/243 product may be considered volume limited. In this case, the environmental impact shall be calculated using the real mass loaded. In EF compliant datasets,the transport payload should be modelled in a parameterised way through the utilisation ratio. The utilisation ratio affects (i) the truck\u2019s total fuel consumption and (ii) the allocation to impact per ton. The utilisation ratio is calculated as the kg real load divided by the kg payload and shall be adjusted when the datasetis used. In case the real load is 0 kg, a real load of 1 kg shall be used forthe calculation. Empty return trips may be included in the utilisation ratio by taking into accountthe percentage of empty km driven. E.g., if the truck is fully loaded for delivery but half empty uponits return, the utilisation ratio is: 22t real load / 22t payload * 50% km + 11t real load / 22t payload * 50% km = 75%. PEF studies shall specify the utilisation ratio to be used for each type of truck transport modelled and clearly indicate whether the utilisation ratio includes empty return trips.The following default utilisation ratios apply. (a) If the load is mass-limited, a default utilisation ratio of 64%29 shall be used, unless specific data is available. This default utilisation ratio includes empty return trips and thus shall not be modelled separately. (b) Bulk transport (e.g., gravel transport from mining pit to concrete plant) shall be modelled with a default utilisation ratio of 50% (100% loaded outbound and 0% loaded inbound), unless specific data is available. 4.4.3.2. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013van transport Vans are often used for home delivery, e.g. delivery of books and clothes or home delivery from retailers. For vans, the limiting factor is volume rather than mass. If no specific information is available to perform the PEF study, a lorry of <1.2t with a default utilisation ratio of 50% shall be used. In case no dataset fora lorry of <1.2t is available, a lorry of <7.5t shall be used as approximationwith autilisation ratio of 20%.

Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013consumer transport Allocation of the car impact shall be based on volume. The maximum volume to be considered for consumer transport is 0.2 m3(around 1/3 of a trunk of 0.6 m3). For products larger than 0.2 m3the full car transport impact shall be considered. For products sold through supermarkets or shopping malls, the product volume (including packaging and empty spaces such as between fruits or bottles) shall be used to allocate the transport burdens betweenthe products transported. The allocation factor shall be calculated as the volume of the product transported divided by 0.2 m3. To simplify the modelling, all other types of consumer transport (like buying in specialised shops or using combined trips) shall be modelled as if sold through a supermarket. 4.4.3.4. Default scenarios \u2013from supplier to factory For suppliers located within Europe, if no specific data are available to perform the PEF study, then the default data provided below shall be used. For packaging materials from manufacturing plants to filler plants (beside glass; values based on Eurostat 201530), the following scenario shall be used: (a) 230 km by truck (>32 t, EURO 4); (b) 280 km by train (average freight train); and (c) 360 km by ship (barge). For transport of empty bottles, the following scenario shall be used: (a) 350 km by truck (>32 t, EURO 4); (b) 39 km by train (average freight train); and (c) 87 km by ship (barge). 29 Eurostat 2015 indicates that 21% of the km truck transport is driven with an empty load and 79% is driven loaded (with an unknown load).

Default scenarios \u2013from EoL collection to EoL treatment The transport from whereproducts at their EoL are collected to where they are treatedmay already be included in the landfill, incineration and recycling LCA datasets. However, there are some cases where additional default data may be needed in the PEF study.

For centres with both ambient and cooled storage: 20% of the DC\u2019s area is chilled or frozen. Note: the energy used for chilled or frozen storage is only the energy used to maintain the temperature. Energy consumption at retail: General energy consumption of 300 kWh/m2\u00b7year for the entire building surface shall be considered as the default. For retail specialisedin non-food/non-beverage products,150 kWh/m2\u00b7year for the entire building surface shall be considered. For retail specialisedin food/beverage products,400 kWh/m2\u00b7year for the entire building surface plus energy consumption for chilled and frozen storage of 1900 kWh/m2\u00b7year and 2700kWh/m2\u00b7year respectively is to be considered (PERIFEM and ADEME, 2014). Refrigerant gases consumption and leakages at DCs with cooling systems: gas content in fridges and freezers is 0.29 kg R404A per m2 (Organization Environmental Footprint Sector Rules for retail sector, retail OEFSR33). Annual leakage of 10% is considered (Palandre 2003). For the portion of refrigerant gases that remain in the equipment at end of life, 5% is emitted at end of life and the remaining fraction is treated as hazardous waste. Only the portionof the emissions and resources emitted or used at storage systems shall be allocated to the product stored. Thisallocation shall be based on the space (in m3) and time (in weeks) occupied by the product stored. For this, the total storage capacity of the system shall be known, and the product-specific volume and storage time shall be used to calculate the allocation factor (as the ratio between product-specific volume*time and storage capacity volume*time). An average DC is assumed to store 60000 m3of product, out of which 48000 m3for ambient storage and 12000 m3 for chilled or frozen storage. For 52 weeks of storage, a default total storage capacity of 3 120 000 m3*weeks/year shall be assumed. An average retail place is assumed to store 2000m3of products (assumingthat50% of the 2000m2building area is covered by shelves that are2 m high) over52 weeks, i.e. 104000 m3* weeks/year. 4.4.6. Sampling procedure In some cases, the user of the PEF method needs a sampling procedure to limit the data collection to only a representative sample of plants, farms etc. The user of the PEF method shall (i) specify in the PEF report if sampling was applied, (ii) follow the requirements described in this section and (iii) indicate which approach was used. Examples of cases when the sampling procedure may be needed are those where multiple production sites are involved in producingthe same product. E.g. ifthe same raw material/input material comes from multiple sites or ifthe same process is outsourced to more than one subcontractor/supplier. The representative sample shall be derived via a stratified sample, i.e. one that ensures that sub-populations (strata) of a given population are each adequately represented within the whole sample of a research study. Using a stratified sample allows for moreprecision than a simple random sample, provided that the sub-populations have been chosen so that the items of the same sub-population are as similar as possible in terms of the characteristics of interest. In addition, a stratified sample guarantees better coverage of the population34. The following procedure shall be applied in order to select a representative sample as a stratified sample: i. define the population; ii. define homogeneous sub-populations (stratification); iii. define the sub-samples at the sub-population level; iv. define the sample for the population starting from the definition of sub-samples at the sub- population level. 33 The OEFSR of the retail sector (v 1.0) is available at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/pdf/OEFSR- Retail_15052018.pdf. 34 The researcher has control over the sub-populations that are included in the sample, whereas simple random sampling does not guarantee that sub-populations (strata) of a given population are each adequately represented within the final sample.

However, one main disadvantage of stratified sampling is that it may be difficult to identify appropriate sub- populations for a population.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/247 4.4.6.1. How to define homogeneous sub-populations (stratification) Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups (sub-populations) before sampling. The sub-populations should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population shall be assigned to only one sub-population. The following aspects needto be taken into consideration in identifyingthe sub-populations: (a) geographicaldistribution of sites; (b) technologies/ farming practices involved; (c) productioncapacity of the companies/sites taken into consideration. Additional aspects to be taken into consideration may be added. The number of sub-populations shall be calculatedasfollows: [Equation 1] \u2022 Nsp: number of sub-populations; Nsp=g\u2217t\u2217c \u2022 g: number of countries in which the sites/plants/farms are located; \u2022 t: number of technologies/farming practices; \u2022 c: number of classes of capacity of companies; In case additional aspects are taken into account, the number of sub-populations is calculated using the above formula and multiplying the result with the numbers of classes identifiedfor each additional aspect (e.g.those sites which have an environmental management or reporting systemin place). Example 1 Identify the number of sub-populations for the following population: Out of 350 farmers located in the same region in Spain, all have more or less the same annual production and use the same harvestingtechniques. In this case: g=1: all the farmers are located in the same country t=1: all the farmers usethe same harvesting techniques c=1: the capacity of the companies is almost the same (i.e. theyhave the same annual production) Only one sub-population may be identifiedas coincidingwith the population. Nsp=g\u2217t\u2217c=1\u22171\u22171=1 Example 2 350 farmers are distributed acrossthree different countries (100 in Spain, 200 in France and 50 in Germany). There are two different harvesting techniques used, and these differ in a relevant way (Spain: 70 technique A, 30 technique B; France: 100 technique A, 100 technique B; Germany: 50technique A). The capacity of the farmers in termsof annual production varies between 10000t and 100000t. According to expert judgement/ relevant literature, it isestimated that farmers with an annual production lower than 50000tare completely different in terms of efficiency compared to the farmers with an annual production higher than 50 000 t. Two classes of companies are defined based on annual production: class 1, if production is lower than 50000 tand class 2, if production ishigher than 50000t. (Spain: 80 class 1, 20 class 2; France: 50 class 1, 150 class 2; Germany: 50 class 1). Table 6includes the details about the population.

How to define sub-sample size at sub-population level Once the sub-populations have been identified, the sample size of eachshall be calculated (the sub-sample size). Two alternative approaches are possible: i. Based on the total production of the sub-population The user of the PEF method shall identify the percentage of production thateach sub-populationwill cover. Itshall not be lower than 50%, expressed in the relevant unit. This percentage determines the sample size within the sub- population. ii.

How to define the sample for the population The representative sample of the population corresponds to the sum of the sub-samples at the sub-population level. 4.4.6.4. What to do in case rounding is necessary Ifrounding is necessary, the general rule used in mathematics shall be applied: (a) If the number you are rounding is followed by 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, round the number up. (b) If the number you are rounding is followed by 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, round the number down. 4.4.7. Modelling requirements for the use stage The use stage often involves multiple processes. A distinction shall be made between (i) product independent and (ii) product dependent processes. (i) Product independent processeshave no relationship with the way the product is designed or distributed. The impacts of the use stage process will remain the same for all products in this product (sub-)category even if the producer changes the product's characteristics. Therefore, they do not contribute to any form of differentiation between two products or might even hide the difference. Examples are: the use of glass for drinking wine (considering that the product does notdetermine a difference in glass use); frying time when using olive oil;", "embedding_index": 36}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_37", "text": " processeshave no relationship with the way the product is designed or distributed. The impacts of the use stage process will remain the same for all products in this product (sub-)category even if the producer changes the product's characteristics. Therefore, they do not contribute to any form of differentiation between two products or might even hide the difference. Examples are: the use of glass for drinking wine (considering that the product does notdetermine a difference in glass use); frying time when using olive oil; energy use for boiling one litre of water used for preparing coffee made from bulk instant coffee; and the washing machine used for heavy laundry detergents (capital good). (ii) Productdependent processesare directly or indirectly determined or influenced by the product design or are related to instructions for usingthe product. These processes depend on the product characteristics and therefore help differentiate two products. All instructions provided by the producer and directed towards the consumer (through labels, websites or other media) shall be considered product dependent. Examples of instructions are: indications on how long the food must be cooked, how much water must be used, or in the case of drinks, the recommended serving temperature and storage conditions. An example of a direct dependent process is the energy used by electricalequipment undernormal conditions. Product dependent processes shall be included in the system boundary of the PEF study. Product independent processes shall be excluded from the system boundary and qualitative information may be provided. For final products,the LCIA results shall be reported for (i) the total life cycle and (ii) the total life cycle excluding the use stage. 4.4.7.1. Main function approach or delta approach The modelling of the use stage may be done in different ways. Very often the related impacts and activities are modelled fully, e.g.the total electricity consumption when using a coffee machine, or the total cooking time and related gas consumption when boiling pasta. In these cases, the use stage processes for drinking coffee or eating pasta are related to the product\u2019s main function(referred to as \u2018main function approach\u2019). In some cases, the use of one product may influence the environmental impact of another, as described in the followingexamples. (a) A toner cartridge is not \u2018responsible\u2019 for the paper it prints on. But if a remanufactured toner cartridge works less efficiently and causes more paper loss compared to an original cartridge, the additional paper loss should be considered. In that case, the paper loss is a product-dependent process of the use stage of a remanufactured cartridge. (b) The energy consumption during the use stage of the battery/charger system is not related to the amount of energy stored and released from the battery. It only refers to the energy loss in each loading cycle, whichmay be caused by the loading system or the internal losses in the battery. In these cases, only the additional activities and processes should be allocated to the product (e.g. paper and energy for the remanufactured toner cartridge and battery respectively). The allocation method involves taking all associated products in the system (in this casepaper and energy), and allocating the excess consumption of these associated products to the product which is considered responsible for this excess. This requires a reference amount\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/251 of consumption to be setfor each associated product (e.g. of energy and materials), which refers to the minimum consumption that is essential for providing the function. The consumption above this reference (the delta) will then be allocated to the product (referred to as \u2018Delta approach\u2019)35. This approach shall only be used to increase impacts and to account for additional consumption above the reference. To setthe reference situation, the following shall be considered, if available: (a) regulationsapplicable to the product in scope; (b) standardsor harmonised standards; (c) recommendationsfrom manufacturers or manufacturers' organisations; (d) useagreements established by consensus in sector-specific working groups. The user of the PEF method candecide which approach is taken and shall describe the one applied in the PEF report (main function approach or delta approach). 4.4.7.2. Modelling the use stage Part D of Annex II provides default data to be used to model use stage activities. If available, better data should be used, and shall be made transparent and justified in the PEF report. 4.4.8. Recycled content and end of life modelling Therecycled content andend of life shall be modelled using the circular footprint formula(CFF) at the life-cycle stage where the activity occurs.The following sections describe the formula and parameters to be used and how they shall be applied to final and intermediate products (Section4.4.8.12). 4.4.8.1.

The A factor The A factor allocates burdens and credits from recycling and virgin material production betweentwo life cycles (i.e. the one supplying and the one using recycled material) and it aims to reflect market realities. An A factor equal to 1 would reflect a 100:0 approach (i.e. credits are given only to the recycled content), while an A factor equal to 0would reflect a 0:100 approach (i.e. credits are given only to the recyclable materials at the EoL). In PEF studies the A factor values shall be in the range 0.2 \u2264 A \u2264 0.8, to always capture both aspects of recycling (recycled content and recyclability at EoL). The driver determiningthe values of the A factor is the analysis of the market situation. This means: 1) A=0.2\u2013lowsupply of recyclable materials and high demand: the formula focuses on recyclability at EoL; 2) A=0.8\u2013highsupply of recyclable materials and low demand: the formula focuses on recycled content. 3) A=0.5\u2013equilibriumbetween supply and demand: the formula focuses both on recyclability at EoLand recycled content. Default application-specific and material-specific A values are available in Part C of Annex II. The following procedure shall be applied (in hierarchical order) to select the value of A to be used in a PEF study: 1) checkin Part C of Annex II the availability of an application-specific A value which fits the PEF study; 2) if an application-specific A value is not available, the material-specific A value in Part C of Annex II shall be used; 36 The European Commission periodically reviews and updates the list of values in the part C of the Annex II; users of the PEF method are invited to check and use the most updated values provided at http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/253 3) ifa material-specific A value is not available, the user shall apply an A value of0.5. 4.4.8.3. The B factor The B factor is used as an allocation factor of energy recovery processes. It applies both to burdens and credits. Credits refer to the amount of heat and electricity sold, not to the total energy produced, taking into account relevant variations over a 12-monthperiod, e.g. for heat. In PEF studies,the B value shall, by default, be equal to 0, unless another appropriate value is available in partC of Annex II. To avoid double-counting between the current and the subsequent system in case of energy recovery, the subsequent system shall model its own energy use from energy recovery processes as primary energy (if the B value has been set at a value other than0 in the upstream system, the user of the PEF method shall ensure that no double counting occurs). 4.4.8.4. The point of substitution It is necessary to determine the point of substitution to apply the \u2018material\u2019 part of the formula. The point of substitution isto the point in the value chain where secondary materials substitute for primary materials. The point of substitution should be identified in correspondence to the process where input flows comefrom 100% primary sources and 100% secondary sources (level 1 in Figure 4). In some cases, the point of substitution may be identified after some mixing of primary and secondary material flows has occurred (level 2 in Figure 4). \u2022 Point of substitution at level 1: this corresponds to e.g. the", "embedding_index": 40}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_41", "text": "o the point in the value chain where secondary materials substitute for primary materials.

The point of substitution at this level may be applied only if the datasets used to model,e.g. E and E take into rec v, account the real (average) flows regarding primary and secondary material. For example, if E corresponds to the rec \u2018production of 1 t of secondary material\u2018 (see Figure 4) and it has an average input of 10% from primary raw materials, the amount of primary materials, together with their environmental burdens, shall be included in the E rec dataset. Figure 4Point of substitution at level 1 and level 2 Figure 4is a schematic representation of a generic situation (flows are 100% primary and 100% secondary). In practice,in some situations more than one point of substitution may be identified at different steps in the value chain, as represented in Figure 5, where e.g. scrap of two different qualities is processed at different steps.

The quality ratios: Qsin/Qp and Qsout/Qp Two quality ratios are used in the CFF, to take into account the quality of both the ingoing and the outgoing recycled materials: Qsin/Qp and Qsout/Qp. Two different cases are highlighted. (a) If Ev=E*v, the two quality ratios are needed: Qs in /Q p associated to the recycled content, and Qs out /Q p associated to recyclability at EoL. The quality factors are there to capture the downcycling of a material compared to the original primary material and, in some cases, may capture the effect of multiple recycling loops. (b) If Ev\u2260E*v,one quality ratio is needed: Qs /Q associated to the recycled content. In this case,E*v refers in p to the functional unit of the material substituted in a specific application. For example, plastic recycled to produce a bench modelled via substitution of cement shall also take into account the \u2018how much\u2019,\u2018how long\u2019 and \u2018how well\u2019. Therefore, the E*v parameter indirectly integrates the Qs /Q parameter, and out p therefore the Qs and Qp parameters are not part of the CFF. out The quality ratios shall be determined at the point of substitution and per application or material. The quantification of the quality ratios shall be based onthe following. (a) Economic aspects: i.e. price ratio of secondary compared to primary materials at the point of substitution. Ifthe price of secondary materials is higher than that of primary ones, the quality ratios shall be set equal to 1. (b) When economic aspects are less relevant than physical aspects, the latter may be used. Packaging materials used by industry are often thesame within different sectors and product groups: Part C of Annex IIprovides one worksheet with Qs /Q and Qs /Q values applicable to packaging materials. The company in p out p conductinga PEF study may use different values, whichshall be made transparent and justified in the PEF report. 4.4.8.6. Recycled content (R1) The R values applied shall be company-specific or default secondary (application-specific), depending on the 1 information available to the company conducting the PEF study. Default secondary (application-specific) R 1\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/255 values are available in Part C of Annex II. The following procedure shall be applied (in hierarchical order) to select the value of R to be used in a PEF study. 1 (a) Company-specific values shall be used either when the process is run by the company conducting the PEF study or when the process is not run by the company conductingthe PEF study but thatcompany has access to (company-)specific information. (Situation 1 and Situation 2of the Data Needs Matrix,see Section4.6.5.", "embedding_index": 41}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_42", "text": " following procedure shall be applied (in hierarchical order) to select the value of R to be used in a PEF study. 1 (a) Company-specific values shall be used either when the process is run by the company conducting the PEF study or when the process is not run by the company conductingthe PEF study but thatcompany has access to (company-)specific information. (Situation 1 and Situation 2of the Data Needs Matrix,see Section4.6.5.4). (b) In all other cases, the default secondary R values of Part C of Annex II (application-specific) shall be 1 applied. (c) When no application-specific value is available in Part C of Annex II, R shall be set to 0% (material- 1 specific values based on supply market statistics are not accepted as a proxy and therefore shall not be used). The applied R values shall be subject to PEF study verification. 1 4.4.8.7. Guidelines when using company-specific R1 values When using company-specific R values other than 0, traceability throughout the supply chain is mandatory. The 1 following general guidelines shall be followed: 1) the supplier information (through e.g., statement of conformity or delivery note) shall be maintained during all theproduction and delivery stages at the converter; 2) oncethe material is delivered to the converter for producingthe end products, the converter shall handle information through their regular administrative procedures; 3) the converter for producing the end products claiming recycled content shall demonstrate through its management system the percentage of recycled input material intothe respective end product(s). 4) The latter demonstration shall be transferred upon request to the person usingthe end product. Ifa PEF profile is calculated and reported, this shall be stated as additional technical information of the PEF profile. 5) Industry- or company-owned traceability systems may be applied as long as they cover the general guidelines outlined above. If not, they shall be supplemented with the general guidelines above. For the packaging industry, the following industry-specific guidelines are recommended. 1) For the container glass industry:the European Commission Regulation No 1179/2012. This Regulation requests a statement of conformity delivered by the cullet producer. 2) For the paper industry: the European Recovered Paper Identification System (CEPI \u2013Confederation of European Paper Industries, 2008). This document prescribes rules and guidance on necessary information and steps, with a delivery note that shall be received bythe milloperator. 3) For beverage cartons no recycled content is used so far.If needed, the same guidelines usedfor paper shall be used in this case as they are themost suitable (beverage cartons are covered by a recovered paper grade category underthe European list of waste paper grades,EN643). 4) For the plastics industry: EN standard 15343:2007. This standard prescribes rules and guidelines on traceability. The supplier of the recyclate is requested to provide specific information. 4.4.8.8. Guidelines on how to deal with pre-consumer scrap When dealing with pre-consumer scrap, two options may be applied.

The statement on recyclability shall be provided together with an evaluation for recyclability that includes evidence for the following three criteria (as described by EN ISO 14021:2016, Section7.7.4 \u2018Evaluation methodology\u2019). 1) The collection, sorting and delivery systems to transfer the materials from the source to the recycling facility are conveniently available to a reasonable proportion of the purchasers, potential purchasers and users of the product. 2) Recycling facilities toaccommodate the collected materialsexist; 3) Evidence is available to show that the product for which recyclability is claimed is being collected and recycled. For PET bottles, the European PET Bottle Platform (EPBP) guidelines should be used (https://www.epbp.org/design-guidelines), while for generic plastics,the recyclability by design should be used (www.recoup.org).

The bill of material (BoM) should be taken as a starting point for calculations if no default data is available. Reuse and refurbishment If the reuse/refurbishment of a product results in a product with different product specifications (providing another function), this shall be considered as part of the CFF, as a form of recycling. Old parts that were changed during refurbishment shall be modelled under the CFF. In this case, reuse/refurbishment activities fall underthe E parameter, while the alternative function provided recEoL (or the avoided production of parts or components) falls under the E*v parameter. 4.4.9. Extended product lifetime Extending a product\u2019slifetime due to reuse or refurbishment may result in the following. 1. A product with the original product specifications (providing the same function). In this situation, the product lifetime is extended to a product with the original product specifications (providing the same function) and shall be included in the FU and reference flow. The user of the PEF method shall describe how reuse or refurbishmentis included in calculatingthe reference flow and the full life-cycle model, taking into account the \u2018how long\u2019 of the FU. 2. A product with different product specifications (providing another function). This shall be considered as part of the CFF, as a formof recycling (see Section4.4.8.13. How to apply the formula to intermediate products (cradle-to-gate studies)). Also, old parts that have been changed during refurbishment shall be modelled under the CFF. 4.4.9.1. Reuse rates (situation 1 in Section4.4.9) The reuse rate is the number of times a material is used at the factory. This is also often called trip rates, reuse time or number of rotations. This may be expressed as the absolute number of reuse or as % of reuse rate. For example: a reuse rate of 80% equals 5 reuses.

It includes both the first use and all of the following reuses. 4.4.9.2 How to apply and model the \u2018reuse rate\u2019 (situation 1 in Section4.4.9) The number of times a material is reused affects the product\u2019s environmental profile at different life-cycle stages. The following five steps explain how the user shall model the different life-cycle stages with reusable materials, using packaging as an example. 1. Raw material acquisition: the reuse rate determines the quantity of packaging material consumed per product sold. The raw material consumption shall be calculated by dividing the actual weight of the packaging by the number of times this packaging is reused. For example, a 1 l glass bottle weighs 600 grams and is reused 10 times (reuse rate of 90%). The raw material use per litre is 60 grams(= 600 grams per bottle / 10 reuses). 2. Transport from packaging manufacturer to the product factory (where the products are packed): The reuse rate determines the quantity of transport that is needed per product sold. The transport impact shall be calculated by dividing the one-way trip impact by the number of times the packaging is reused. 3. Transport from product factory to final client and back: in additionto the transport needed to go to the client, the return transport shall also be taken into account. To model the total transport, see Section4.4.3 on modelling transport. 4. Attheproduct factory: once the empty packaging is returned to the product factory, energy and resource use shall be taken into consideration as regardscleaning, repairing or refilling (if applicable).\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/261 5. Packaging EoL: the reuse rate determines the quantity of packaging material (per product sold) to be treated at the EoL. The amount of packaging treated at the EoLshall be calculated by dividing the actual weight of the packaging by the number of times it was reused. 4.4.9.3. Packaging reuse rates A packaging return system is organisedby: 1. thecompany that ownsthe packaging material (company-owned pools);or 2. athird party e.g.the government or a pooler (third party operated pools). This may affect the material\u2019s lifetime as well as the data source to be used. Therefore, it is important to separate these two return systems. For company-owned packaging pools, the reuse rate shall be calculated using supply chain specific data. Depending on the data available within the company, two different calculation approaches may be used (see option \u2018a\u2019 and option \u2018b\u2019 below). Returnable glass bottles are used as an example but the calculations also apply for another company-owned reusable packaging. Option \u2018a\u2019: use supply-chain-specific data, based on accumulated experience over the lifetime of the previous glass bottle pool. This is the most accurate way of calculatingthe reuse rate of bottles for the previous bottle pool and is a proper estimate for the current bottle pool. The following supply chain-specific data is collected. 1. Number of bottles filled during the bottle pool\u2019s lifetime (#F) i 2. Number of bottles at initial stock plus purchased over the bottle pool\u2019s lifetime (#B) Reuse rate of the bottle pool = [Equation 5] # Fi The net glass use (kg glass/l be#vBerage) = [Equation 6] #B\u00d7(kg glass/bottle) This calculation option shall be used: #Fi (i) With data from the previous bottle pool when the previous and current bottle pool are comparable, meaning, the same product category, similar bottle characteristics (e.g.size), comparable return systems (e.g.collectionmethods, same consumer group and outlet channels), etc. (ii) With data from the current bottle pool when future estimations/extrapolations are available on (i) the bottle purchases, (ii) the volumes sold, and (iii) the bottle pool\u2019s lifetime. The data shall be supply-chain-specific and shall be verified during the verification and validation process, including the reasoning for the method choice. Option \u2018b\u2019: If no real data is tracked, the calculation shall be done partly based on assumptions. This option is less accurate due to the assumptions made and therefore conservative/safe estimates shall be used. The following data is needed. 1.

The user of the PEF method may use other values if they are justified and data sources are provided. The user of the PEF method shall indicate if company-owned or third party operated pools were in scope and which calculation method or default reuse rates were used. 4.4.10 Greenhouse gases emissions and removals The PEF method distinguishes three main categories of greenhouse gases(GHG) emissions and removals, each contributing tolevels withina specific sub-category withinthe impact category of 'climate change': 1. fossilGHG emissions and removals (contributing to the sub-category \u2018Climate change \u2013fossil\u2019); 2. biogeniccarbon emissions and removals (contributing to the sub-category \u2018Climate change \u2013biogenic\u2019); 3. carbonemissions from land use and land use change (contributing to the sub-category \u2018Climate change \u2013 land use and land use change\u2019). Currently, credits associated with temporary and permanent carbon storage and/or delayed emissions shall not be considered in the calculation of the climate change indicator. This means that all emissions and removals shall be considered as emitted \u2018now\u2019,and there is no discounting of emissions over time (in line with EN ISO 14067:2018). Developments will be considered in order to keep the method updated with scientific evidence and expert-based consensus. The sub-categories \u2018climate change \u2013fossil\u2019, \u2018climate change \u2013biogenic\u2019 and \u2018climate change -land use and land transformation\u2019, shall be reported separately if they show a contribution of more than 5%42each to the total score of climate change. 4.4..1 Sub-category 1: Climate change \u2013fossil This category covers GHG emissions to any media originating from the oxidation and/or reduction of fossil fuels by means of their transformation or degradation (e.g.combustion, digestion, landfilling, etc.). This impact category includes emissions from peat(used as a fuel)and calcination, and uptakes due to carbonation. Fossil CO uptake and corresponding emissions (e.g. due to carbonation) shall be modelled in a simplified way 2 when calculating the PEF profile (meaning no emissions or uptakes shall be modelled). When knowledge about the amount of fossil CO uptake is required for additional environmental information, the CO uptake may be 2 2 modelled with the flow \u2018carbon dioxide (fossil), resources from air\u2019.

Technical specifications guarantee a lifetime of 10 years. A return of 3 times per year (between 2 to 4) is taken as a first approximation. 40 The less conservative number is used. 41 Half of plastic pallets is used as an approximation 42 For example,let: Let us assume that \u2018Climate change \u2013biogenic\u2019 contributes with 7% (using absolute values) to the total climate change impact and \u2018Climate change \u2013land use and land use change\u2019 contributes with 3% to the total climate change impact. In this case, the total climate change impact and the \u2018Climate change \u2013biogenic\u2019 shall be reported.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/263 composting, landfilling),and(ii)CO uptake from the atmosphere through photosynthesis during biomass growth, 2 i.e. corresponding to the carbon content of products, biofuels or above-ground plant residues such as litter and dead wood. Carbon exchanges from native forests43shall be modelled under sub-category 3 (including connected soil emissions, derived products or residues). Modelling requirements: the flows falling under this definition shall be modelled consistently with the elementary flows in the most recent version of the EF package and useflow names that endwith \u2018(biogenic)\u2019. Mass allocation shall be applied to model the biogenic carbon flows. A simplified modelling approach should be used only if the flows which influence the results ofclimate change impact (namely biogenic methane emissions) are modelled. This option may apply, for example, to food PEF studies as it avoids modelling human digestion while eventually arriving at a zero balance. In this case, the following rules apply: (i) onlythe emission \u2018methane (biogenic)\u2019 is modelled; (ii) nofurther biogenic emissions and uptakes from the atmosphere are modelled; (iii)ifmethane emissions are bothfossil andbiogenic, the release of biogenic methane shall be modelled first, followed bythe remaining fossil methane. For intermediate products (cradle-to-gate), the biogenic carbon content at the factory gate (physical content) shall always be reported as \u2018additional technical information\u2019. 4.4..3 Sub-category 3: Climate change \u2013land use and land use change (LULUC) This sub-category accounts for carbon uptakes and emissions (CO, CO and CH) originating from carbon stock 2 4 changes caused by land use change and land use. This sub-category includes biogenic carbon exchanges from deforestation, road construction or other soil activities (including soil carbon emissions). For native forests, all related CO emissions are included and modelled under this sub-category (including connected soil emissions, 2 products derived from native forests44and residues), while their CO uptake is excluded. 2 A distinction is made between direct and indirect land use change. Direct land use change occurs as the result of a transformation from one land use type into another, which takes place in a particular/certain piece ofland cover, possibly leading tochanges in the carbon stock of that specific piece of land, but not in other systems. Examples of direct land use change are the conversion of land used for growing crops to industrial use or conversion from forestland to cropland. Indirect land use change occurs when a certain change in land use, or in the use of the feedstock grown on a given piece of land, causeschanges in land use outside the system boundary, i.e. in other land use types.

Indirect land use change occurs when a certain change in land use, or in the use of the feedstock grown on a given piece of land, causeschanges in land use outside the system boundary, i.e. in other land use types. ThePEF method only considers direct land use change, while indirect land use change, due to the lack of an agreed methodology, shall not be taken into account in PEF studies. Indirect land use change may be included under additional environmental information. Modelling requirements: the flows falling under this definition shall be modelled consistently with the elementary flows in the most recent version of the EF package and use the flow names that end with \u2018(land use change)\u2019. Biogenic carbon uptakes and emissions shall be inventoried separately for each elementary flow. For land use change: all carbon emissions and removals shall be modelled following the modelling guidelines of PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011) and the supplementary document PAS2050-1:2012 (BSI 2012) for horticultural products. Quoting PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011): \u2018Large emissions of GHGs can result as a consequence of land use change. Removals as a direct result of land use change (and not as a result of long-term management practices) do not usually occur, although it is recognized that this could happen in specific circumstances. Examples of direct land use change are the conversion of land used for growing crops to industrial use or conversion from forestland to cropland. All forms of land use change that result in emissions or removals are to be included. Indirect land use change refers to such conversions of land use as a consequence of changes in land use elsewhere. While GHG emissions also arise from indirect land use change, the methods and data requirements for calculating these emissions are not fully developed.

For countries and land use changes not included in this annex, the emissions arising from the product shall be assessed using the included GHG emissions and removals occurring as a result of direct land use change in accordance with the relevant sections of the IPCC (2006).

Knowledge of the prior land use can be demonstrated using a number of sources of information, such as satellite imagery and land survey data. Where records are not available, local knowledge of prior land use can be used. Countries in which a crop is grown can be determined from import statistics, and a cut-off threshold of not less than 90% of the weight of imports may be applied.

For soil carbon stock: soil carbon emissions shall be included and modelled under this sub-category (e.g. from rice fields). Soil carbon emissions derived from aboveground residues (except from native forests) shall be modelled under sub-category 2, such as the application of non-native forest residues or straw. Soil carbon uptake (accumulation) shall be excluded from the results, e.g. from grasslands or improved land management through tilling techniques or other management measurestaken relatedto agricultural land.

If legislation has different modelling requirements for the sector, such as the EU Decision on greenhouse gas accounting from 201346, which indicates carbon stock accounting, it shall be modelled according to the relevant legislation and provided under additional environmental information. 45 In case of variability of production over the years, a mass allocation should be applied. 46Decision No529/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21May 2013 on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities relating to land use, land-use change and forestry and on information concerning actions relating to those activities, OJ L 165/80.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/265 4.6.1 Offsets The term \u2018offset\u2019 is frequently used to refer to third-party GHG mitigation activities, e.g. regulated schemes that are part of the Kyoto Protocol (the former clean-development mechanism; joint implementation), new mechanisms discussed in the context of negotiations article 6 of the Paris agreement emissions trading schemes, or voluntary schemes. Offsets are GHG reductions used to compensate for (i.e. offset) GHG emissions elsewhere, for example to meet a voluntary or mandatory GHG target or cap. Offsets are calculated relativeto a baseline that represents a hypothetical scenario for what emissions would have been in the absence of the mitigation project that generates the offsets. Examples are carbon offsetting by the clean development mechanism, carbon credits, and other system- external offsets. Offsets shall not be included in the impact assessment of a PEF study, but shall be reported separately as additional environmental information. 4.5 Handling multi-functional processes If a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\u2018co- products\u2018), it is \u2018multifunctional\u2019. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process shall be partitioned between the product of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner. Systems involving multi-functionality of processes shall be modelled in linewith the following decision hierarchy. Specific allocation requirements in other sections of this method always prevail over the ones available in this section (e.g. Sections4.", "embedding_index": 50}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_51", "text": ".e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\u2018co- products\u2018), it is \u2018multifunctional\u2019. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process shall be partitioned between the product of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner. Systems involving multi-functionality of processes shall be modelled in linewith the following decision hierarchy. Specific allocation requirements in other sections of this method always prevail over the ones available in this section (e.g. Sections4.4.2on electricity, 4.4.3 on transport, 4.4.10on GHGemissions, or 4.5.1on slaughterhouse activities). Decision hierarchy 1) Subdivision or system expansion As per EN ISO 14044:2006, wherever possible, subdivision or system expansion should be used to avoid allocation. Subdivision refers to disaggregating multifunctional processes or facilities to isolate the input flows directly associated with each process or facility output. System expansion refers to expanding the system by including additional functions related to the co-products. It shall be investigated first whether it is possible to subdivide or expand the analysed process. Where subdivision is possible, inventory data shall be collected only for those unit processes directly attributable47to the goods/services of concern. Or, if the system may be expanded, the additional functions shall be included in the analysis,with results communicated for the expanded system as a whole rather than on an individual co-product level. 2) Allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship Where it is not possible to apply subdivision or system expansion, allocation should be applied: the inputs and outputs of the system should be partitioned between its different products or functions in a way that reflects relevant underlying physical relationships between them (EN ISO 14044:2006). Allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship refers to partitioning the input and output flows of a multi-functional process or facility in linewith a relevant, quantifiable physical relationship between the process inputs and co-product outputs (for example, a physical property of the inputs and outputs that is relevant to the function provided by the co-product of interest). Allocation based on a physical relationship may be modelled using direct substitution, if it is possible to identify a product that is directly substituted. To demonstrate thatthe direct substitution effect is robust, the user of the PEF method shall prove that: (1) there is a direct, empirically demonstrable substitution effect, AND (2) it is possible to model the substituted product and to subtract the LCI in a directly representative manner: if both conditions are fulfilled, model the substitution effect. Ortoallocate input/output based on some other relevant underlying physical relationship that relates the inputs and outputs to the function provided by the system, the user of the PEF method shall demonstrate that it is possible to define a relevant physical relationship by which to allocate the flows attributable to the provision of the defined function of the product system: if this condition is fulfilled, the user of the PEF method may allocate based on this physical relationship. 47 Directly attributable refers to a process, activity or impact occurring within the defined system boundary.\n\nL 471/266 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 3) Allocation based on some other relationship Allocation based on some other relationship may be possible. For example, economic allocation refers to allocating inputs and outputs associated with multi-functional processes to the co-product outputs in proportion to their relative market values. The market price of the co-functions should refer to the specific conditionsand stage of the process inwhich the co-products are produced. In any case, to ensure the physical representativeness of the PEF results as far as possible a clear justification for having discarded 1) and 2) and for having selected a certain allocation rule in step 3) shall be provided. Allocation based on some other relationship may be approached in one of the following alternative ways. (i) Is it possible to identify an indirect substitution48effect and can the substituted product be modelled and the inventory subtracted in a reasonably representative manner? If yes (i.e. both conditions are verified), model the indirect substitution effect. (ii) Is it possible to allocate the input/output flows between the products and functions on the basis of some other relationship (e.g. the relative economic value of the co-products)? If yes, allocate products and functions based on the relationshipidentified. The circular footprint formula(seeSection4.4.8.1)provides the approach that shall be used to estimate the overall emissions that result froma certain process involving recycling and/or energy recovery. These moreover also relate to waste flows generated within the system boundary. 4.5.1 Allocation in animal husbandry This section provides instructions on how to address specific issues related to the modelling of farm, slaughterhouse and rendering for cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.

In particular, instructions are provided on: 1. allocationof upstream burdens at farm level among outputs leaving the farm 2. allocationof upstream burdens (linked to live animals) at slaughterhouse level among outputs leaving the slaughterhouse. 4.5.1.1 Allocation within the farm module At farm module, subdivision shall be used for processes that are directlyallocated tocertain outputs (e.g. energy use and emissions related to milking processes). If the processes cannot be subdivided due to the lack of separate data or because it is technically impossible, the upstream burden, e.g. feed production, shall be allocated to farm outputs using a biophysical allocation method. Default values used forallocation are provided in the following sections for each type of animal. These default values shall be used inPEF studies unless company-specific data are collected. Changingallocation factors is only allowed if company-specific data are collected and used for the farm module. In case secondary data are used for the farm module, no change of allocation factors is allowed. 4.5.1.2 Allocation within the farm module for cattle The International Dairy Federation (IDF)(2015) allocation method between milk, cull cows and surplus calves shall be used. Dead animals and all products from dead animals shall be regarded as waste and the circular footprint formula shall be applied. In this case, however, the traceability of the products from dead animals shall be guaranteed to enable PEF studies to take this aspect into consideration. Manure exported to another farm shall be considered asone of the following. (a) Residual (default option):if manure does not have an economic value at the farm gate, it is regarded as residual without allocation of an upstream burden. The emissions related to manure management up to the farm gate are allocated to the other farm outputs where manure is produced. (b) Co-product: when exported manure has an economic value at the farm gate, an economic allocation of the upstream burden shall be used for manure by using the relative economic value of manure compared to milk and live animals at the farm gate. However, biophysicalallocation based on IDF rules shall be applied to allocate the remaining emissions between milk and live animals. (c) Manure as waste: when manure is treated as waste (e.g. landfilled), the circular footprint formula shall be applied. 48 Indirect substitution occurs when a product is substituted but you do not know by which products exactly.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/267 The allocation factor (AF) for milk shall be calculated using the following equation: [Equation 8] Mmeat M meat is the mass of live weight of all aAniFm=als1 s\u2212old6 .0in4cl\u2217udMimngilk bull calves and culled mature animals per year and M is the mass of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) sold per year (corrected to 4% fat and 3.3% protein). milk The constant 6.04 describes the causal relationship between the energy content in feed in relation to the milk and live weight of animals produced.

At the slaughterhouse and rendering module stage, subdivision shall be used for those process flows that are directly attributable to certain outputs. If it is not possible to subdivide the processes, the remaining flows (e.g. excluding those already allocated to milk for milk producing systems or to wool for wool producing systems) shall be allocated to the slaughterhouse and rendering outputs using economic allocation. Default allocation factors are provided in the following sections for cattle, pigs and small ruminants (sheep, goat). These default values shall be used in PEF studies. Changes to the allocation factors are notallowed. 4.5.1.6 Allocation within the slaughterhouse for cattle At the slaughterhouse, the allocation factors are established for the five product categories described in Table 17. If allocation factors used for subdividingthe impact of the carcass among the different cuts are preferred, they shall be defined and justified in the PEF study. The by-products that originate fromtheslaughterhouse and rendering are classified in three categories. Category 1: Risk materials, e.g. infected/contaminated animals or animal by-products: disposaland use: incineration, co-incineration, landfill, used as biofuel for combustion, manufacture of o derived products. Category 2: Manure and digestive tract content, products of animal origin unfit for human consumption: disposal and use: incineration, co-incineration, landfill, fertilisers, compost, used as biofuel for o combustion, manufacture of derived products. Category 3: Carcasses and parts of animals slaughtered which are fit for human consumption but are not intended to be used for this purposefor commercial reasons, including skins and hides going to the leather industry (note that hides and skins may also belong to other categories depending on the condition and nature that is determined by the accompanying sanitary documentation): disposaland use: incineration, co-incineration, landfill, feed, pet food, fertilisers, compost, used as biofuel o for combustion, manufacture of derived products (e.g. leather), oleo-chemicals and chemicals.

The data shall include all known inputs and outputs for the processes. Examples for inputs: use of energy, water, land, materials. Examples of outputs: the products, co-products, emissions and waste generated. Emissions are divided into three compartments (emissions to air, to water and to soil). There are several ways to collect company-specific emission data, for example, they can be based on direct measurements or calculated using company-specific activity data and related emission factors (e.g. litre of fuel consumption and emission factors for combustion in a vehicle or boiler). Whenever the sector of the product in scope is covered by EU ETS monitoring rules, the user of the PEF method should follow quantification requirements as set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 for the processes and GHGs covered therein. Forcarbon capture and storage,the requirements ofthis Annex prevail.The data may need scaling, aggregation or other forms of mathematical treatment to bring them in line with the functional unit and reference flow of the process. Typical specific sources of company-specific data are: (a) process-or plant-level consumption data; (b) billsand stock/inventory changes of consumables; (c) emissionmeasurements (amounts and concentrations of emissions from flue gas and wastewater); (d) compositionof products and waste; (e) procurementand sale department(s)/unit(s). All new datasets created when conducting a PEF study shall be EFcompliant. All company-specific data shall be modelled in company-specific datasets. The bill of material (BoM)61hastwo parts: the list of materials/ingredients and the quantity used for each of them. The activity data of the BoM shall be specific to the product in scope and modelled with company-specific data. For companies producing more than one product,the activity data used (including the BoM) shallbe specific to the product covered bythe study. The modelling of the manufacturing processes shall be based on company-specific data (e.g. energy needed to assemblethe materials/components of the product in scope). For companies producing more than oneproduct,the activity data used (including the BoM) shall be specific to the product covered bythe study. 4.6.2 Secondary data Secondary data refer to data not based on direct measurements or on calculation of the respective processes in the system boundary. Secondary data areeither sector-specific, i.e. specific to the sector being considered for the PEF study, or multi-sector.

The sources of thesedata used shall be clearly documented and reported in the PEF report. 4.6.3 Datasets to be used PEF studies shall use secondary datasets that are EF compliant, when available. To develop secondary EF compliant datasets, the Guide for EF compliant datasetsshall be followed62. Ifan EF compliant secondary dataset does not exist or cannot be developed, the selection of the datasets to be used shall be done according to the following rules, provided in hierarchical order. 1. Use an EFcompliant proxy (if available); the use of proxy datasets shall be reported in the limitations section of the PEF report,;data converted from previous EF compliance systems (e.g. EF2.0 to EF3.0) are considered proxies. 2. Use an ILCDentry level (EL)compliant dataset as aproxy63.A maximum of 10% of the single overall scoremay be derived from ILCD-EL compliant datasets . 3. If no EF compliant or ILCD-EL compliant dataset is available, then the process shall be excluded from the model. This shall be clearly stated in the \u2018limitations\u2019section of the PEF report as a data gap and validated by the verifier. 4.6.4 Cut-off Any cut-off shall be avoided, unless under the following rules. Processes and elementary flows may be excluded up to 3.0% (cumulatively)based on material and energy flows and the level of environmental significance (single overall score). The processes subject to acut-off shall be made explicit and justified in the PEF report, in particular with reference to the environmental significance of the cut- off applied. This cut-off has to be considered in additionto the cut-off already included in the background datasets. This rule is valid for both intermediate and final products. The processes that (cumulatively) account for less than 3.0% of the material and energy flow, as well as the environmental impact for each impact category may be excluded from PEF study. A screening study is recommended to identify processes that may be cutoff. 4.6.5 Data quality requirements This section describes how the data quality of EF compliant datasets shall be assessed. The data quality requirements are presented in Table 20. \u2022 Two minimum requirements: (i) completeness; (ii) methodological appropriateness and consistency. Once the processes and products are chosen, which represent the system analysed, and their LCIs are inventoried, the completeness criterion evaluates how much the LCI covers all the emissions and resources of the processes and products that are required to calculate all EF impact categories. Fulfilling thecompleteness criterion andbeing fully in line with the PEF method arepre-requisitesfor EF compliant 62seehttps://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/permalink/Guide_EF_DATA.pdf 63 In case an ILCD-EL compliant dataset is used, the nomenclature of the elementary flows shall be aligned with the EF reference package used by the EF compliant datasets in the rest of the model (available on the EF developer\u2019s page at the following link http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml).\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/275 datasets.

The DQR of the sub-processes shall be assessed throughthe Data Needs Matrix The DQR of the newly developed dataset shall be calculated as follows. 1. Select the most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows: most-relevant activity data are those linked to sub-processes (i.e. secondary datasets) accountingfor at least 80% of the total environmental impact of the company-specific dataset. Listthem in order, from those which contribute the most to those which contribute the least.Most-relevant direct elementary flows are defined as those which contribute cumulatively at least 80% to the total impact of the direct elementary flows. 2.

Eachmost-relevant direct elementary flow consists of the amount and elementary flow naming (e.g. 40 g CO). For each most-relevant elementary flow, the 4 DQR criteria \u2013TeR , TiR , 2 -EF -EF GeR , P \u2013shall be evaluated (e.g. the timing of the flow measured, for which technology the -EF EF flow was measured and in which geographical area). b.

Considering that both activity data and direct elementary flows shallbe company-specific, the score of P cannot be higher than 3,while the score for TiR, TeR, and GeR cannot be higher than 2 (the DQR score shall be \u22641.5). 3. Calculate as a percentage the environmental contribution of each most-relevant activity data (bylinking to the appropriate sub-process) and direct elementary flow to the total sum of the environmental impact of all most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows, (weighted, using all EF impact categories). For example, the newly developed dataset has only two most-relevant activity data, contributing to 80% of the total environmental impact of the dataset: Activity data 1 carries 30% of the total dataset environmental impact.

Environmental footprintimpact assessment Once the LCI has been compiled, the EF impact assessment74shall be carried outto calculate the environmental performance of the product, using all the EF impact categories and models. EF impact assessment includes four steps: classification, characterisation, normalisation and weighting. Results of a PEF study shall be calculated and reported in the PEF report as characterised, normalised and weighted results for each EF impact category and as a single overall score based on the weighting factors provided in Section 6.5.2.2. Results shall be reported for (i) the total life cycle, and (ii) the total life cycle excluding the use stage. 5.1Classification and characterisation 5.1.1 Classification Classification requires assigning the material/energy inputs and outputs inventoried in the LCI to the relevant EF impact category. For example, during the classification phase, all inputs/outputs that result in GHG emissions are assigned to the climate change category. Similarly, those that result in emissions of ozone-depleting substances are assignedto the ozone depletion category. In some cases, an input or output may contribute to more than one EF impact category (for example, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) contribute to both climate change and ozone depletion). It is important to express the data in terms of the constituent substances for which characterisation factors (see next section) are available. For example, data for a composite NPK fertiliser shall be disaggregated and classified according to its N, P, and K fractions, because each constituent element will contribute to different EF impact categories. In practice, much of the LCI data may be drawn from existing public or commercial LCI databases, where classification has already been implemented. In such cases, it must be assured, e.g.by the provider, that the classification and linked EF impact assessment pathways correspond to the requirements of the PEF method. All inputs and outputs inventoried whilethe LCIis being compiledshallbe assigned to the EF impact categories to which they contribute using the classification data made available by the European Commission JRC75. As part of the classification of the LCI, data should be expressed in terms of constituent substances for which characterisation factors are available, as far as possible. 5.1.2 Characterisation Characterisation refers to calculatingthe magnitude of the contribution of each classified input and output to their respective EF impact categories, and aggregatingthe contributions within each category. This is carried out by multiplying the values in the LCI by the relevant characterisation factor for each EF impact category. The characterisation factors are substance-or resource-specific. They represent the impact intensityof a substance relative to a common reference substance for an EF impact category (impact category indicator). For example, whencalculating climate change impacts, all GHG emissions inventoried in the LCI are weighted in terms of their impact intensity relative to carbon dioxide, which is the reference substance for this category. This allows for the impact potential and expression to be aggregated in terms of a single equivalent substance (in this case, CO 2 equivalents) for each EF impact category. All classified inputs and outputs in each EF impact category shall be assigned characterisation factors representing the contribution per unit of input or output to the category, using the provided characterisation factors76. EF impact assessment results shall subsequently be calculated for each EF impact category by multiplying the amount of each input/output by its characterisation factor and summing the contributions of all inputs/outputs within each category to obtain a single measure expressed in the appropriate reference units. 74 The EF Impact Assessment does not intend to replace other (regulatory) methods that have a different scope and objective such as (Environmental) Risk Assessment ((E)RA), site-specific Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or health and safety regulations at product level or related tosafety at the workplace. In particular, the EF Impact Assessment does not have the objective of predicting if at any specific location at any specific time thresholds are exceeded and actual impacts occur. In contrast, it describes the existing pressures on the environment. Thus, the EF Impact Assessment is complementary to other well-proven tools, adding the life-cycle perspective. 75 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 76 Available online at http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/283 5.2Normalisation and weighting Following the steps of classification and characterisation, the EF impact assessment shall be complemented with normalisation and weighting. 5.2.1 Normalisation of environmental footprintimpact assessment results Normalisation is the step in which the LCIA", "embedding_index": 69}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_70", "text": "://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/283 5.2Normalisation and weighting Following the steps of classification and characterisation, the EF impact assessment shall be complemented with normalisation and weighting. 5.2.1 Normalisation of environmental footprintimpact assessment results Normalisation is the step in which the LCIAresults are divided by normalisation factors to calculate and compare the magnitude of their contributions to the EF impact categories relative to a reference unit. As a result, dimensionless, normalised results are obtained. These reflect the burdens that are attributedto a product relative to the reference unit. Within the PEF method the normalisation factors are expressed per capita based on a global value77. Normalised environmental footprint results donot, however, indicate the severity or relevance of the respective impacts. In PEF studies, normalised results shall not be aggregated as this implicitly applies equal weighting. Characterised results shall be reported alongside the normalised results. 5.2.2 Weighting of environmental footprintimpact assessment results Weighting is a mandatory step in PEF studies and it supports the interpretation and communication of the analysis results. In this step, normalised results are multiplied by a set of weighting factors (in %) which reflect the relative importance of the life-cycle impact categories considered. Weighted results of different impact categories may then be compared to assess their relative importance. They may also be aggregated across life-cycle impact categories to obtain a single overall score, expressed in points. The process underpinning the development of EFweighting factors is reported in Sala et al. 2018. The weighting factors78that shall be used in PEF studies are provided online7980. The results of the EF impact assessment prior to weighting (i.e. characterised and normalised) shall be reported alongside weighted results in the PEF report. 77 The EF normalisation factors to be used are available at http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 78 For more information on existing weighting approaches in PEF, please refer tothe reports developed by the JRC available online at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/documents/2018_JRC_Weighting_EF.pdf 79 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 80 Please note that the weighting factors are expressed in % and thus shall be divided by 100 before applying in the calculations.\n\nL 471/284 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 6. Interpretation of product environmental footprintresults 6.1Introduction Interpretingthe results of the PEF study serves two purposes. 1. Firstly, to ensure that the performance of the PEF model corresponds to the study\u2019s goals and quality requirements.In this sense, life-cycle interpretation may inform iterative improvements of the PEF model until all goals and requirements are met. 2. Secondly,to derive robust conclusions and recommendations from the analysis, for example,in support of environmental improvements. To meet these objectives, the interpretation phase shall include the steps outlined in this section. 6.2Assessment of the robustness of the product environmental footprintmodel Assessing the robustness of the PEF model evaluates the extent to which methodological choices such as the system boundary, data sources, and allocation choices influence the analytical outcomes. Tools that should be used to assess the PEF model\u2019s robustness includethe following. (a) Completeness checks, toassess the LCI data to ensure it is complete relative to the defined goals, scope, system boundary and quality criteria. This includes completeness of process coverage (i.e. all processes at each supply chain stage considered have been included) and input/output coverage (i.e. all material or energy inputs and emissions associated with each process have been included). (b) Sensitivity checks, to assess the extent to which the results are determined by specific methodological choices, and the impact of implementing alternative choices where these can be identified.It is useful to structure sensitivity checks for each phase of the PEF study, including goal and scope definition, the LCI, and the EF impact assessment. (c) Consistency checks, to assess the extent to which assumptions, methods, and data quality considerations have been applied consistently throughout the PEF study. Any issues flagged in this evaluation may be used to inform iterative improvements to the PEF study. 6.3Identification of hotspots: most-relevant impact categories, life-cycle stages, processes and elementary flows Once the user of the PEF method ensuresthat the PEF model is robust and conforms to all aspects defined in the goal and scope definition phases, the main contributing elements", "embedding_index": 70}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_71", "text": " assess the extent to which assumptions, methods, and data quality considerations have been applied consistently throughout the PEF study. Any issues flagged in this evaluation may be used to inform iterative improvements to the PEF study. 6.3Identification of hotspots: most-relevant impact categories, life-cycle stages, processes and elementary flows Once the user of the PEF method ensuresthat the PEF model is robust and conforms to all aspects defined in the goal and scope definition phases, the main contributing elements to the PEF results shall be identified. This step may also be referred to as \u2018hotspot\u2019 analysis. The user of the PEF method shall identify and list in the PEF report (together with the %) the most relevant: 1. impactcategories 2. life-cycle stages 3. processes 4. elementaryflows. There is an important operational difference between most-relevant impact categories and life-cycle stages on one hand and most-relevant processes, and elementary flows on the other. In particular, most-relevant impact categories and life-cycle stages may be mainly relevant in the context of communicatingthe results of a PEF study. They might serve to highlightenvironmental areaswherethe organisationshould focus their attention. Identifyingthe most-relevant processes and elementary flows is more important for the engineers and designers to identify actions for improving the overall footprint, e.g. by-passingor changing a process, further optimising a process, or applyinganti-pollution technology. This is particularly relevant for internal studies, to look deeper into how to improve the product\u2019s environmental performance.The procedure that shall be followed to identify the most-relevant impact categories, life-cycle stages, processes and elementary flows is described in the following sections.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/285 6.3.1 Procedure to identify the most-relevant impact categories The identification of the most-relevant impact categories shall be based on the normalised and weighted results. The most-relevant impact categories shall be identified as all of those impact categories that togethercontribute to at least 80%ofthe single overall score. This shall start from the largest to the smallest contributions. At least three relevant impact categories shall be identified as most-relevant ones. The user of the PEF method may add more impact categories to the list of the most-relevant ones but none shall be deleted. 6.3.2 Procedure to identify the most-relevant life-cycle stages The most-relevant life-cycle stages are thosethat together contribute more than80%to any of the most-relevant impact categories identified. This shallstart from the largest to the smallest contributions. The user of the PEF method may add more life-cycle stages to the list of the most-relevant ones but none shall be deleted. At a minimum, the life-cycle stages described at Section4.2shall be considered. If the use stage accounts for more than 50% of the total impact of a most-relevant impact category, the procedure shall be re-run, excludingthe use stage. In this case, the list of most-relevant life-cycle stages shall be those selected through the latter procedure plus the use stage. 6.3.3 Procedure to identify the most-relevant processes Each most-relevant impact category shall be further investigated by identifying the most-relevant processes used to model the product in scope. The most-relevant processes are those that togethercontribute more than80%to any of the most-relevant impact categories identified. Identical processes81 taking place in different life-cycle stages (e.g. transportation, electricity use) shall be accounted for separately. Identical processes taking place within the same life-cycle stage shall be accounted for together. The list of most-relevant processes shall be reported in the PEF report together with the respective life-cycle stage (or multiple life-cycle stages if relevant) and the contribution in %. The identification of the most-relevant processes shall be carried outaccording toTable 26. Table 26Criteria to select at which life-cycle stage level to identify the most-relevant processes \u2014 Contribution of the use stage to the total \u2014 Most-relevant processes identified at the level of impact of a most-relevant impact category \u2014 \u2265 50% \u2014 wholelife-cycle excluding use stage, and \u2014 usestage \u2014 < 50% \u2014 wholelife cycle This analysis shall be reported separately for each most-relevant impact category. The user of the PEF method may add more processes to the list of the most-relevant ones but none shall be deleted. 6.3.4 Procedure to identify the most-relevant elementary flows The most-relevant elementary flows are defined as those elementary flows that together contributeat least 80%to the total impact of each most-relevant specific impact category for each most-relevant process, starting from those that contribute the most to those that contribute", "embedding_index": 71}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_72", "text": " separately for each most-relevant impact category. The user of the PEF method may add more processes to the list of the most-relevant ones but none shall be deleted. 6.3.4 Procedure to identify the most-relevant elementary flows The most-relevant elementary flows are defined as those elementary flows that together contributeat least 80%to the total impact of each most-relevant specific impact category for each most-relevant process, starting from those that contribute the most to those that contribute the least.This analysis shall be reported separately for each most- relevant impact category. Elementary flows belonging to the background system of a most-relevant process may dominate the impact. Therefore, if disaggregated datasets are available, the user of the PEF method should also identify the most- relevant direct elementary flows for each most-relevant process. Most-relevant direct elementary flows are defined as those direct elementary flows that together contributeat least 80%to the total impact of the direct elementary flows of the process, for each most-relevant impact category. The analysis shall be limited to the direct emissions of the level-1 disaggregated datasets82. This means that the 80% cumulative contribution shall be calculated against the impact caused by the direct emissions only, and not against the total impact of the process. 81 Two processes are identical when they have the same UUID. 82 Seehttp://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml) for description of level-1 disaggregated datasets.\n\nL 471/286 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 The user of the PEF method may add more elementary flows to the list of those that aremost-relevant but none shall be deleted. The list of most-relevant elementary flows (or, if applicable, direct elementary flows) per most- relevant process shall be reported in the PEF report. 6.3.5 Dealing with negative numbers When identifying the percentage impact contribution for any process or elementary flow, it is important that absolute values be used. This makes it possibleto identify the relevance of any credits (e.g.from recycling). In case of processes or flows with a negative impact score, the following procedure shall be applied: (a) consider the absolute values (i.e. impacts of processes or flows to have a plus sign, namely a positive score); (b) the total impact score needs to be recalculated including the converted negative scores; (c) the total impact score is set to 100%; (d) the percentage impact contribution for any process or elementary flow is assessed according to this new total. This procedure does not apply to identify the most-relevant life-cycle stages. 6.3.6 Summary of requirements Table 27summarises the requirements to define most-relevant contributions. Table 27Summary of requirements to define most-relevant contributions Item At what level does relevance Threshold need to be identified? Most-relevant Single overall score Impact categories that together contribute toat least impact categories 80%of the single overall score. Most-relevant life- For each most-relevant impact All life-cycle stages that together contribute more cycle stages category than80%to that impact category. If the use stage accounts for more than 50% of the total impact of a most-relevant impact category, the procedure shall be re-run, excludingthe use stage.

Product environmental footprintreports 7.1Introduction A PEF report complements the PEF study, providing a relevant, comprehensive, consistent, accurate, and transparent summary of the study. It reproduces the best possible information in such a way as to maximise its usefulness to intended current and future users, whilst transparently communicating the limitations. Effective PEF reporting requires that several criteria, both procedural (report quality) and substantive (report content), are met. A PEF report template is available in PartE of Annex II. Thistemplate includes the minimum information to be reported in a PEF report. At a minimum, aPEF report consists of: a summary, the main report, the aggregated EF compliant dataset and an annex.

Verification and validation of PEF studies, reports, and communication vehicles Ifpolicies on implementing the PEF method define specific requirements as regardsverification and validation of PEF studies, reports and communication vehicles, then theserequirements shall prevail. 8.1Defining the scope of the verification The verification and validation of the PEF study is mandatory whenever the study, or part of the information therein, is used for any type of external communication (i.e. communication to any interested party other than the commissioner or the user of the PEF method of the study). Verification means the conformity assessment process carried out by an environmental footprint verifier(s) to check whether the PEF study has been carried out in compliance with Annex I. Validationmeans the confirmation by the environmental footprint verifier(s)who carried out the verification, that the information and data included in the PEF study,thePEF report and the communication vehiclesavailable at the time of validation are reliable, credible and correct. The verification and validation shall cover the following three areas: 1. the PEF study (including, but not limited to the data collected, calculated, and estimated and the underlying model); 2. the PEF report; 3. the technical content of the communication vehicles, if applicable. The verification of the PEF study shall ensure that the PEF study is conducted in compliance with Annex I or the applicable PEFCR. The validation of information in the PEF study shall ensure that: (a) the data and information used for the PEF study are consistent, reliable and traceable; (b) the calculations performed do not include significant84mistakes. The verification and validation of the PEF report shall ensure that: (a) the PEF report is complete, consistent, and compliant with the PEF report template provided in PartE of Annex II; (b) the information and data included are consistent, reliable and traceable; (c) the mandatory information and sections are included and appropriately filled in; (d) all the technical information that could be used for communication purposes, independently from the communication vehicle to be used, are included in the report.

The commissioner shall select the verifier(s)or verification team following the rules outlined in Section 9.3.1. 2. The verification shall take placefollowing the verification process described in Section9.4. 3. The verifier(s)shall communicate to the commissioner any misstatement, non-conformities and need for clarifications (Section9.3.2), and draft the validation statement (Section8.5.2) 4. The commissioner shall respond to the verifier's comments and introduce necessary corrections and changes (if needed) to ensure the final compliance of the PEF study, PEF report and technical content of PEF communication vehicles. If, in the verifier's judgement, the commissioner does not respond appropriately within a reasonable time period, the verifier shall issue a modified validation statement. 5. The final validation statement is provided, considering (if needed) the corrections and changes introduced by the commissioner. 6. Surveillance that the PEF report is available during the validity of the validation statement (as defined in Section 8.5.3) If a matter comes to the verifier's attention that causes the verifier to believe in the existence of fraud or noncompliance with laws or regulations, the verifier shall communicate this immediately to the commissioner of the study. 8.3Verifier(s) This section is without prejudice to specificprovisions of EU legislation. The verification/validation may be conducted by a single verifier or by a verification team. The independent verifier(s) shall be external to the organisation that conducted the PEF study.

Depending on the nature of the outcomes, additional iterations of comments and responses may be necessary. Any changes made in response to the verification or validation outcomes shall be documented and explained in theverification or validation report. Suchasummary may take\n\nL 471/294 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 the form of a table in the respective documents. The summary shall include the comment(s)fromthe verifier(s), the commissioner\u2019s answer and the motivation for the changes. Verification may take place afterthe PEF study has been concluded or in parallel (concurrent) to the study, while validation shall always take place afterthe studyhas been concluded. The verification/validation shall combine document review and model validation. \u2022 Thedocument review includes the PEF report, the technical content of related communication vehicles available at the time of validation, and the data used in the calculations through requested underlying documents. Verifier(s) may organise the document review eitheras an \u2018at desk\u2019or \u2018on-site\u2019exercise, or as a mix of the two. The validation of the company-specific data shall always be organised through a visit tothe production site(s) the data refer to. \u2022 Thevalidation of the model may take place at the production site of the commissioner of the study or be organised remotely. The verifier(s) shall access the model to verify its structure, the data used, and its consistency with the PEF report and PEF study. The commissioner of the PEF study and the verifier(s) shall agree on how the verifier(s) accesses the model. \u2022 The validation of the PEF report shall be carried out by checking enough information to provide reasonable assurance that the content is in line with the modelling and results of the PEF study. The verifier(s) shall ensure that data validation includes: a) coverage, precision, completeness, representativeness, consistency, reproducibility, sources and uncertainty; b) plausibility, quality and accuracy of the LCA-based data; c) quality and accuracy of additional environmental and technical information; d) quality and accuracy of the supporting information. The verification and validation of the PEF study shall be carried out by following the minimum requirements listed in Section8.4.1 8.4.1 Minimum requirements for the verification and validation of the PEF study The verifier(s) shall validate the accuracy and reliability of the quantitative information used in the calculation of the study. As this may be highly resource intensive, the following requirements shall be fulfilled. \u2022 Theverifier(s) shall check if the correct version of all impact assessment methods was used. For each of the most-relevant EF impact categories (ICs), at least 50% of the characterisation factors shall be verified, while all normalisation and weighting factors of all ICs shall be verified. In particular, the verifier(s) shall check that the characterisation factors correspond to those included in the EF impact assessment method the study declares compliance with87. This may also be done indirectly, for example: 1) Export the EF-compliant datasets from the LCA software used to do the PEF study and run them in Look@LCI88to obtain LCIA results. If Look@LCI results are within a deviation of 1% from the results in the LCA software, the verifier(s) may assume that the implementation of the characterisation factors in the software used to do the PEF study was correct. 2) Compare theLCIA results of the most-relevant processes calculated with the software used to do the PEF study with the ones available in the metadata of the original dataset.

At least 50% (in number) of the datasets used to model most-relevant processes and 10% of those used to model other processes shall be checked. The verifier(s) shall check if the aggregated EF compliant dataset representing the product in scope is made available to the European Commission89. The commissioner of the PEF study may decide to make the dataset public. Additional environmental and technical information fulfils the requirements at Section3.2.4.1. 8.4.2 Verification and validation techniques The verifier(s) shall assess and confirm whether the calculation methodologies applied are of acceptable accuracy, reliable, are appropriate and performed in line with the PEF method. The verifier(s) shall confirm the correct application of conversion of measurement units. The verifier(s) shall check if applied sampling procedures are in linewith the sampling procedure defined in the PEF method as set outin Section4.4.6. The data reported shall be checked against the source documentation in order tocheck their consistency. The verifier(s) shall evaluate whether the methods for making estimates are appropriate and have been applied consistently. The verifier(s) may assess alternatives to estimations or choices made, to determine whether a conservative choice has been selected. The verifier(s) may identify uncertainties that are greater than expected and assess the effect of the identified uncertainty on the final PEF results. 8.4.3 Data confidentiality Data for validation shall be presented in a systematic and comprehensive way. All the project documentation supporting the validation of a PEF study shall be provided to the verifier(s), including the EF model, confidential information, data, and the PEF report. The verifier(s) shall treat all information and data undergoing verification/validation as confidential and shall use them only during the verification/validation process. The commissioner of the PEF study may exclude confidential data and information from the PEF report, provided that: \u2022 only input information is excluded and all output information is included; \u2022 the commissioner provides the verifier(s) with sufficient information of the nature of the data and information excluded as well asthe reasoning for excluding them; \u2022 the verifier(s) accept(s) the non-disclosure and includes in the verification and validation report the reasons for doing so; if the verifier(s) do(es)not accept the non-disclosure and the commissioner does not take corrective action, the verifier(s) shall include in the verification and validation report that the non- disclosure is not justified; \u2022 the commissioner keeps a file of the non-disclosed information for possible future re-evaluation of the decision fornon-disclosure.

The verification and validation report and the validation statement shall clearlyidentify the specific PEF study under verification (e.g. by including the title, the commissioner of the PEF study, the user of the PEF method \u2013 see Sections8.5.1 and 8.5.2), together with the explicit version of the final PEF report to which the verification and validation report and a validation statement apply (e.g. by including the report date, the version number). Both the verificationand validation report and the validation statement shall be completed based on the final PEF report, after the implementation of all the corrective actions requested by the verifier(s). They shall carry the handwritten or electronic signature of the verifier(s) in line with Regulation (EU) n\u00b0 910/201491. The maximum validity of the verification and validation report and of the validation statement shall not exceed three years starting from their issue date. During the validity period of the verification, surveillance (follow-up) shall be agreed between the commissioner of the PEF study and the verifier(s) to evaluate if the content is still consistent with the current situation (the suggested periodicity for this follow-up is once per year, to be agreed between the PEF study commissioner and the verifier(s)). The periodic checks shall focus on the parameters that according to the verifier(s) might lead to relevant changes in the results of the PEF study. This means, that the results shall be recalculated considering the changes of the identified parameters. Thelist of such parameters includes: \u2022 bill of material/bill of components; \u2022 energy mix used for processes in Situation1 of the Data Needs Matrix; \u2022 change of packaging; \u2022 changes in the suppliers (materials/geography); \u2022 changes in the logistics; \u2022 relevant technological changes in the processes in Situation1 of the Data Needs Matrix. At the time of the periodic check the reasons for non-disclosure of information should also be reconsidered. The surveillance verification may be organised as a document check and/or through on-site inspections. Regardless of the validity, the PEF study (and consequently the PEF report) shall be updated during the surveillance period if the results of one of the impact categories communicated has worsened by more than 10.0% compared to the verified data, or if the total aggregated score has worsened by more than 5.0% compared to the verified data. If these changes also affect the content of the communication vehicle, it shall be updated accordingly. 91Regulation N\u00b0 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive1999/93/EC, OJEU L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73.\n\nL 471/298 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 References ADEME (2011): General principles for an environmental communication on mass market products BPX 30-323- 0.

PEFCRs are named differently to prevent confusion between other analogous rules and uniquely identify rules under the PEF method. Based on an analysis carried out by JRC in 201092, the Commission came to the conclusion that existing life cycle based standards do not provide sufficient specificity to ensure that the same assumptions, measurements and calculations are made to support comparability of environmental claims across products delivering the same function. PEFCRs aim at increasing comparability, reproducibility, consistency, relevance, focus and efficiency of PEF studies. A PEFCR should be developed and written in a format that persons with technical knowledge (in LCA as well as with regard to the considered product category) can understand and can use to conduct a PEF study. Each PEFCR shall implement the materiality principle, meaning thata PEF study shall focus on those aspects and parameters that are the most relevant for the environmental performance of a given product. By doing this the time, effort and cost of carrying out the analysis is reduced. Each PEFCR shall specify the minimumlist of processes (mandatory processes) that shall always be modelled with company-specific data. The purpose is to avoid that users of the PEFCR are able to perform a PEF study and communicate its results without having access to the relevant company-specific (primary) data and by using only default data. The PEFCR shall define this mandatory list of processes based on their relevance and the possibility to have access to company-specific data. The definitions provided under the Annex Iare applicable also for this Annex. A.1.1. Role of PEFCRs and relation with existing Product Category Rules The development of a PEFCR should take into account, to the extent possible, already existing technical documents and PCRs from other schemes. As defined in EN ISO 14025:2010, Product Category Rules (PCRs)93include sets of specific rules, guidelines and requirements to develop \u2018Type III environmental declarations\u2019for any product category (i.e. goods and/or services providing equivalent functions). \u2018Type III environmental declarations\u2019are quantitative, LCA-based claims of the environmental aspects94 of a certain good or service,", "embedding_index": 90}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_91", "text": "R should take into account, to the extent possible, already existing technical documents and PCRs from other schemes. As defined in EN ISO 14025:2010, Product Category Rules (PCRs)93include sets of specific rules, guidelines and requirements to develop \u2018Type III environmental declarations\u2019for any product category (i.e. goods and/or services providing equivalent functions). \u2018Type III environmental declarations\u2019are quantitative, LCA-based claims of the environmental aspects94 of a certain good or service, e.g. quantitative information regarding potential environmental impacts. Type III environmental declarations may, for instance, be a potential application of a PEF study. For the development and review of Product CategoryRules (PCRs), EN ISO 14025:2010describes the procedure and establishes requirements for the comparability of different so-called \u2018Type III environmental declarations\u2019. The guidelines on how to develop PEFCRs take into consideration the minimum content of a PCR document as required by EN ISO 14025:2010. A.1.2. How to manage modularity In case of intermediate products, the PEFCR becomes a \u2018module\u2019 to be used when developing PEFCRs for products further down the same supply chain. This is equally applicable if the intermediate product can be used in different supply chains (e.g. metal sheets). The development of \u2018modules\u2019allows for a higher level of consistency among different supply chains that are using the same modules as part of their LCA. Furthermore, the development of \u2018modules\u2019is essential to keep the number of PEFCRs manageable. The possibility to build such modules should always be considered also for final products, especially for those products that share part of the production chain and then differentiate due to different functions (e.g. detergents). 92 Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organisations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment(2010), available at: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/dev_methods.htm 93 Product Category Rules (PCR) are a set of specific rules, requirements and guidelines for developing Type III environmental declarations for one or more product categories (EN ISO 14025:2010). 94 An environmental aspect is defined as an element of an organisation\u2019s activities or products that has or can have an impact on the environment.\n\nL 471/312 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 There are different scenarios that may require a modular approach: (a) A final product using in its BoM an intermediate product forwhich there is already an existing PEFCR (e.g. car production with leather upholstery) or a final product that becomes part of the life cycle of another product (e.g. detergent used to wash a T-shirt); (b) A final product using a component or product that is already used as a component by another PEFCR (e.g. fittings to be used in piping systems, fertilisers). For scenario (a), the new PEFCR shall define how to manage the productinformation based on the environmental relevance of the product and the DNM(see section A.4.4.4.4.). This means that if the product is \u2018most relevant\u2019 and it is under the company\u2019s control, company-specific data shall be requested, following the rules of the PEFCR having the module in its scope95. If it is not under the company\u2019s operational control but amongst the \u2018most relevant\u2019processes, the user of the PEFCR may choose either to provide company-specific data, or to use the EF compliant secondary dataset96provided with the PEFCR that has the module in its scope. In scenario (b), the Technical Secretariat (see the role and the membership in section A.2.2. shall assess the feasibility of implementing the same modelling assumptions and secondary datasets listed in the existing PEFCR. If feasible, the Technical Secretariat shall implement the same modelling assumptions and dataset to be used in its own PEFCR. If not feasible, the Technical Secretariat shall agree on a solution with the Commission. 95 In case the already existing PEFCR used as a module is updated during the validity of the PEFCR relying on it, the old version prevails and stays valid for the duration of the validity of the newly developed PEFCR. 96 This is a mandatory deliverable for any representative product developed in a PEFCR.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/313 A.2.

The following situations might occur: Development of a new PEFCR; (a) Full revision of an existing PEFCR; (b) Partial revision of an existing PEFCR. For cases (a) and (b) the procedure described in this section (see figure A-1) shall be followed. Case (c) is only allowed if the model of the Representative Product (RP), (see section) is updated with corrected/new data or datasetsand correction of obvious mistakes, and the results of the RP change with a certain maximum: (i) LCIA results change <10% per impact category (characterized results), and (ii) LCIA results change <5% of the single overall score, and (iii)the list of most relevant impact categories, life cycle stages, processes, and direct elementary flows do not change.

Figure J-1\u2013Process flow to create/revise a PEFCR. PEF-RP: PEF study of the Representative Product. A.2.1. Who can develop a PEFCR A Technical Secretariat shall be set up to develop a PEFCR. The Technical Secretariat shall represent at least 51% of the EU consumption market (sold) in terms of economic turnover. The Technical Secretariat shall achieve this market coverage directly by companies participating in it and/or indirectly, through the EU market coverage of members represented by a business association. The Technical Secretariat shall submit a confidential report proving market coverageto the Commission when establishing the Technical Secretariat. A.2.2. Role of the Technical Secretariat The Technical Secretariat(TS)is responsible for the following activities: (a) Drafting the PEFCR in compliance with the rules included in Annex I and this Annex;\n\nL 471/314 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 (b) Harmonisation with existing PCRs/ PEFCRs; (c) Organising public consultations on draft versions of the documents, analysis of comments, and providing written feedback; (d) Co-ordinating the supporting studies; (e) Managing the public online platform for the respective PEFCR. This activity includes tasks such as the drafting of publicly available explanatory materials related to the PEFCR, online consultations on drafts and publishing of feedback on stakeholder comments; (f) Ensuring the selection and appointment of competent independent PEFCR review panel members. A.2.3. Definition of the representative product(s) The TSshall develop a \u2018model\u2019of the representative product (RP) sold on the EU market. The RP shall reflect the current situation, at the time of developing the PEFCR. This means, for example,that future technologies, future transport scenarios or future end of life treatments shall be excluded. The data used shall reflect realistic market averages and be the most recent (especially for fast developing technology products). Conservative values or estimates shall be avoided. The RP may be a real or a virtual (non-existing) product. The virtual product should be calculated based on average European market sales-weighted characteristics of all existing technologies/materials covered by the product category or sub-category. Other weighting sets may be used, if justified, for example,weighted average based on mass (ton of material) or weighted average based on product units (pieces). When identifying the RP there is the risk that different technologies with very different market shares get mixed up and the ones with a relatively small market share might be overlooked. In such cases the TSshall include the missing technologies/products (if in scope) in the definition of the representative product or provide written justification if this is not technically possible. The RP is the basis for the PEF study of the representative product (PEF-RP). The RP may be a final product or an intermediate product. For final products and intermediate products where a benchmark is defined,it is also the basis for identifying the corresponding benchmark. Section A.3.1 explains for", "embedding_index": 92}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_93", "text": " might be overlooked. In such cases the TSshall include the missing technologies/products (if in scope) in the definition of the representative product or provide written justification if this is not technically possible. The RP is the basis for the PEF study of the representative product (PEF-RP). The RP may be a final product or an intermediate product. For final products and intermediate products where a benchmark is defined,it is also the basis for identifying the corresponding benchmark. Section A.3.1 explains for which product categories or sub- categories a RP shall be developed, while section A.3.2.3 indicates what shall be documented in the PEFCR. A.2.4. First PEF study of the representative product(s) A first PEF study shall be carried out on each representative product (first PEF-RP). The first PEF-RP aims to: 1. Identify the most relevant impact categories; 2. Identify the most relevant life cycle stages, processes and elementary flows; 3. Identify data needs, data collection activities and data quality requirements. The TScarries out the first PEF-RP on the \u2018model\u2019of the RP(s). Lack of available data and low market shares shall not be an argument for exclusions of technologies or production processes. The TSshall use EF compliant datasets for the PEF-RP, if available. If an EF compliant dataset does not exist, the following procedure shall be followed in hierarchical order: 1. If an EF compliant proxy can be found it shall be used; 2. If an ILCD-EL compliant dataset as aproxy can be found: it shall be used but shall not be included in the list of default datasets of the first draft PEFCR. The proxy shall be listed in the limitations of the first draft PEFCR with the following text: \u2018This dataset is used as a proxy during the first PEF-RP only. However, the company performing the supporting study to test the first draft PEFCR shall apply an EF compliant dataset, if available (following the rules laid out in section A.4.4.2on which datasetsto use). If this is not available, the company shall use the same proxy as used for the calculation of the first PEF- RP.\u2019 3. If no EF compliant or ILCD-EL compliant dataset can be found, another dataset may be used.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/315 In the first PEF-RP no cut-off of processes, emissions to the environment and resources from the environment is allowed. All the life cycle stages and processes shall be covered (including capital goods). However, activities like staff commuting, canteens at production sites, consumables not strictly related to production processes, marketing, business trips and R&D activities may be excluded. Cut-offs may only be included in the final PEFCR based on the rules included in the Annex I and this Annex. A first PEF-RP report shall be provided (following template in part E of the Annex II) and shall include the characterised, normalised and weighted results. The first PEF-RP and its report shall be verified by the review panel and a public review report shall be provided as its annex. A.2.5. First draft PEFCR Based on the results of the first PEF-RP the TSshall produce a first draft PEFCR, used to carry out the PEFCR supporting studies. It shall be drafted according to the requirements included in this Annex and the template provided in part B of this Annex. It shall include all the requirements needed for the supporting studies, with particular reference to company-specific data collection tables and procedures. A.2.6. Supporting studies The goal of the supporting studies is to test the implementability of the first draft PEFCR and, to a lesser extent, provide indications about the suitability of the identified most relevant impact categories, life cycle stages, processes and direct elementary flows. For each RP at least three PEF supporting studies shall be carried out. The supporting studies shall be in compliance with all requirements included in the first draft PEFCR and the Annex I. The following additional rules shall be followed: -No cut-off is allowed; -Each study shall implement the hotspot analysis described in section 6.3 of Annex I and section A.6.1 of this Annex. Each study shall be carried out on real products as currently sold in the European market; -To better analyse the applicability of thefirst draft PEFCR, the studies shall be carried out on products from (i) companies of different sizes, including at least one SME if present in the sector; (ii) companies characterized by different production processes/ technologies; and (iii) companies with the main production processes (i.e. the ones for which company-specific data", "embedding_index": 93}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_94", "text": "6.1 of this Annex. Each study shall be carried out on real products as currently sold in the European market; -To better analyse the applicability of thefirst draft PEFCR, the studies shall be carried out on products from (i) companies of different sizes, including at least one SME if present in the sector; (ii) companies characterized by different production processes/ technologies; and (iii) companies with the main production processes (i.e. the ones for which company-specific data are collected) located in different countries. Each supporting study shall be carried out by an entity that is neither involved in the drafting of the PEFCR nor is part of the review panel. Exceptions to this rule may exist but they have to be in agreement with the European Commission. No aggregated EF compliant dataset has to be made available to the European Commission A PEF report shall complement each supporting study and provide a relevant, comprehensive, consistent, accurate, and transparent summary of the study. The PEF report template to be used for the supporting studies template is available in Annex E of this Annex. The template includes the minimum information to bereported. The supporting studies (and their related PEF report) are confidential. They shall only be shared with the European Commission or the body overseeing the PEFCR development, and the review panel. However, the company performing the supporting study may decide to grant access to other stakeholders. A.2.7. Second PEF study of the representative product Conducting the PEF study of the representative product is an iterative process. Based on the information gathered through the first consultation and thesupporting studies, the Technical Secretariat shall carry out a second PEF- RP. This second PEF-RP shall include EF compliant datasets, updated default activity data and all assumptions that are at the basis of the requirements in the second draft PEFCR. Based on the second PEF-RP, the Technical Secretariat shall draft a second PEF-RP report. The TSshall use EF compliant datasets if available for free. In case EF compliant datasets are not available, the following rules shall be followed in hierarchicalorder:\n\nL 471/316 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 \u2022 An EF compliant proxy is available for free: it shall be included in the list of default processes of the PEFCR and stated within the limitations sectionof the second draft PEFCR. \u2022 An ILCD-entry level (EL) compliant dataset as proxy is available for free: A maximum of 10% of the single overall score may be derived from ILCD-EL compliant datasets. \u2022 If no EF compliant or ILCD-EL compliant dataset is available for free: it shall be excluded from the model. This shall be clearly stated in the second draft PEFCR as a data gap and validated by the PEFCR verifiers. The second PEF-RP shall determine all the requirements of the final PEFCR including, but not limited to, the final list of most relevant impact categories, life cycle stages, processes, directelementary flows, cut-offs, etc. For final products, it shall also identify the values for the benchmark. A second PEF-RP report shall be provided (following the template in part E of this annex)and shall include the characterised, normalised and weighted results. The second PEF-RP and its report shall be reviewed by the review panel and a public review report shall be provided as its annex. A.2.8 The second draft PEFCR The TSshall draft the second draft PEFCR taking into consideration the results of thesupporting studies and of the second PEF-RP. All the sections in the PEFCR template (see part B in this Annex) shall be filled in. The PEFCR shall clarify that all the data gaps included in the PEFCR will remain data gaps for its entire validity as they have a direct impact on the benchmark. Therefore, data gaps are indirectly part of the system boundary of the PEFCR to allow a fair comparison with the benchmark. A.2.9. The PEFCR review A.2.9.1. Review panel The TS shall set up an external independent third-party review panel for the PEFCR review. The panel shall be composed of minimum three members (a chair and two members).In case a PEFCR entails more than five RP, the review panel could be enlarged with more members and additional co-chairs.The panel shall include one EF/LCA expert (with a background on the product category or sector under consideration and product-related environmental aspects), one industry expert and, if possible, one representative from NGOs. One member shall be selected as the lead reviewer. The reviewers shall be independent from each other from a legal entity point of view. The panel shall not include representatives of the members97of the TS or other entities", "embedding_index": 94}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_95", "text": " than five RP, the review panel could be enlarged with more members and additional co-chairs.The panel shall include one EF/LCA expert (with a background on the product category or sector under consideration and product-related environmental aspects), one industry expert and, if possible, one representative from NGOs. One member shall be selected as the lead reviewer. The reviewers shall be independent from each other from a legal entity point of view. The panel shall not include representatives of the members97of the TS or other entities involved in the work of the TS, or employees of the companies running the supporting studies. Exceptions to this rule are to be discussed and agreed with the European Commission. A review team can change during the development of a PEFCR. Members can leave or join in between two reviews steps. However, it is the duty of the lead reviewer to ensure that the criteria for the review panel are fulfilled at each and every step of the PEFCR development process; the new members are updated by the lead reviewer about the previous stepsand issues discussed. Lead reviewer can change as long as one of the others takes his/her role and ensures continuity of the work. The review process will include milestones, e.g. 1) 1stPEF-RP + 1stdraft PEFCR, 2) supporting studies + 2ndPEF- RP+2nddraft PEFCR, 3) final draft PEFCR 4) final PEFCR. The continuity should be ensured within the same milestone. The previous requirement means that at least one member of the review team shall stay active in the project. If the requirements are not met, the review process shall start from the last milestone that fulfilled the requirements. 97 If an industry association is member of a Technical Secretariat, an industry expert of one company belonging to that industry association can be in the review panel. On the contrary, experts on the payroll of the association shall not be members of the review panel.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/317 The assessment of the competences of the review panel is based on a scoring system that takes into account their experience, EF/LCA methodology and practice, and knowledge of relevant technologies, processes or other activities included in the product(s) in scope of the PEFCR. Table 32 of the Annex I presents the scoring system for each relevant competence and experience topic. The review panel members shall provide a self-declaration of their qualifications, stating how many points they achieved for each criterion and the total points achieved. This self-declaration shall be included in the PEFCR review report. The minimum necessary score to qualify as a reviewer is six points, including at least one point for each of the three mandatory criteria (i.e. review practice, EF/LCA methodology and practice, and knowledge of technologies or other activities relevant to the EF study). A.2.9.2 Review procedure The TS shall agree on the review procedure with the review panel when signing the review contract. In particular, the TS shall agree the period available to the review panel for producing comments after each document is released by the TS and how to manage the comments received. The review panel will be responsible for the independent review of the following documents (see figure 1): \u2022 Any draft version of the PEFCR (first, second and final); \u2022 First and second PEF-RP, including the RP model, data and PEF-RP reports; \u2022 Supporting studies, including the related PEF model, data and PEF report; If the second consultation or the PEFCR review affects the results of the second PEF-RP, the second PEF-RP shall be updatedand the results shall be implemented in the final draft PEFCR. In this case, the final draft PEFCR and final PEFCR shall be reviewed by the review panel. The panel shall send the review of each document to the TS for their analysis and discussion. The TS shall review the panel\u2019s comments and proposals, and it shall develop a response for each. For all documents, the TS shall generate written responses through review reports that may include: \u2022 Acceptance of the proposal: change the document to reflect proposal, \u2022 Acceptance of the proposal: change the document with modification to the original proposal, \u2022 Supporting comments on why the TS did not agree with the proposal, \u2022 Return to the review panel with further questions on the comments/proposals.

If the PEFCR defines several RPs, the review shall check that all the RPs defined in the PEFCR are included in the scope of the different PEF-RP studies. In addition to the guidelines provided in section 8.4, the following review steps shall be made: 1. Assure that the instructions given in sections A.2.4., A.3.2.7., A.4.2, A.4.3., A.4.4.3, A.6.1. and 4.4.9.4 are followed; 2. Evaluate whether the methods used to make estimates are appropriate and applied consistently; 3. Identify uncertainties that are greater than expected and assess the effects of the identified uncertainty on the final PEF results; 4. For intermediate products PEF-RPs, validate if (i) the A value of the product in scope is set to 1 for the hotspot analysis and (ii) if this is documented in the PEFCR; 5. Check that the GHG emissions and removals are calculated and reported following the rules of section A.4.2.9. 6.

Product categories and sub-categories Products having similar functions and applications should be grouped within the same PEFCR. The scope of the PEFCR shall be selected in a way that it is sufficiently wide to cover different applications and/or technologies. In some cases, to fulfil this requirement, a product category may be split into multiple sub-categories. The TSshall decide if sub-categories are necessary to achieve the primary objective of the PEFCR and therefore to avoid the risk that the hotspot results from different technologies get mixed up or the results of the ones with a small market 98http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 99 All EF and ILCD-EL compliant datasets used for modellingthe RPshall be made available at the same terms and conditions as provided in the EF compliant data guide(available at http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml).\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/321 share are overlooked100. It is necessaryto be as specific as possible when defining the product category and sub- categories to ensure comparability of results. The PEFCR shall be structured with a section including the \u2018horizontal\u2019rules that are common to all products in scope of the PEFCR, and then a section for each sub-category including the specific \u2018vertical\u2019 rules applicable only to that sub-category (Figure A-3). As a general principle, the horizontal rules prevail over the vertical ones; however, specific derogations from this principle may be allowed if properly justified. This structure will make it easier to widen the scope of an existing PEFCR by adding more product sub-categories. Each sub-category shall be clearly described in the scope definition of the PEFCR, each sub-category shall have its own RP and benchmark101 together with its selection of most relevant processes, life cycle stages, direct elementary flows and impact categories. For each RP (and thus sub-category) at least three PEF supporting studies shall be carried out (see section A.3.6). Figure L-3\u2013Example of a PEFCR structure with product category specific horizontal rules, various product sub- categories, and product sub-category specific vertical rules. For final products, the PEFCR shall enable the comparison of products belonging to the same product category and/or sub-category (see Table A-1). If sub-categories are part of the PEFCR scope, a comparison of products belonging to the same sub-category shall always be allowed.

For final products, the PEFCR shall enable the comparison of products belonging to the same product category and/or sub-category (see Table A-1). If sub-categories are part of the PEFCR scope, a comparison of products belonging to the same sub-category shall always be allowed. However, the TS may decide, and shall explicitly state in the PEFCR, if a comparison among all products belonging to the overarching product category is allowed. In this case: 1. a RP shall be defined also at overarching product category level and it should be modelled based on the European market shares (based on turnover) of the RPs covered by the sub-categories. Other aggregation rules may be used, if justified. 2. the TSshall provide the benchmark values of each RP in the PEFCR, both at overarching category and sub-category level. 100 Thisto ensure that the hotspot analysis reflects all different technologies. 101 A benchmark is only applicable to final products (section A.5.1)\n\nL 471/322 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 3. for the RP of the overarching category the most relevant impact categories shall be calculated for communication purposes, in addition to the calculation of the most relevant impact categories, life cycle stages,processes and direct elementary flows identified for the RP of each sub-category.

All requirements in Annex II apply to product categories and sub-categories (if applicable). A.3.2. Scope of the PEFCR Meaningful comparisons may only be made if products are fulfilling the same main function (as expressed through the functional unit). Therefore, the scope of a PEFCR for final products should be defined based on the function, with any deviations to be justified. The scope should include as many products as possible available in the market that deliver the same main function: this approach also enables to link the product category with the Classification of Products byActivity (CPA) codes and it is line with the definition of a product category by EN ISO 14025:2010(i.e. a group of products that can fulfil equivalent functions). The scope section of the PEFCR shall contain, as a minimum, the following information: 1. General description of the scope of the PEFCR: a. Description of the product category; b. List and description of sub-categories included in the PEFCR (if any); c. Description of the product(s) and technical performance; 2. Product classification (CPA codes for the products in scope); 3. Description of the Representative Product(s) and how it has been derived; 4. Functional unit and reference flow; 5. System boundary description and diagram; 6. List of EF impact categories; 7.

General description of the scope of the PEFCR The PEFCR scope definition shall include a general description of the product category, including the granularity of scope, the product sub-categories included (if any), a description of the product(s) in scope and their technical performance. If a product fulfils more than one function and these additional functions are not included in the PEFCR scope and if other products fulfil the same function but they are not included in the scope of the PEFCR, then these omissions shall be explained and documented (see sectionA.3.2.4). A.3.2.2. Use of CPA codes The CPA codes corresponding to the products in scope shall be listed in the PEFCR.

A.3.2.2. Use of CPA codes The CPA codes corresponding to the products in scope shall be listed in the PEFCR. CPA codes relate to activities as defined using NACE codes (i.e. by the Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE)). Each CPA product is assigned to one single NACE activity; hence the CPA structure is parallel to that of NACE at all levels. The International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) and NACE have the same code at the highest levels, but NACE is more detailed at the lower levels. A.3.2.3. Definition of the representative product (RP) The PEFCR shall include in the scope a short description of the RP(s). The Technical Secretariatshall provide information about all the steps taken to define the \u2018model\u2019of the RP and report the information gathered in an Annex to the PEFCR. Should any piece of confidential information be included in the Annex, it should only be made available for reviewing (by the EC, market surveillance authorities or reviewers). A.3.2.4. Functional unit (FU) The FU of a PEFCR shall describe qualitatively and quantitatively the function(s) of the product according to the four aspects reported in Table HH-2-2. The table includes additional requirements for food and non-food PEFCRs that shall be adapted in the respective PEFCRs. In case applicable standards exist, they shall be used and cited in the PEFCR. For intermediate products, the FU is more difficult to define because they can often fulfil multiple functions and the whole life cycle of the product is not known. Therefore, a material-based approach (or declared unit) may be chosen. For example, mass (kilogram) or volume (cubic meter). The PEFCR shall explain and document any omission of the functions of the product in the definition of the functional unit and justify why.

In case the type of packaging affects the shelf-life, this shall be taken into account. The PEFCR shall describe (i) how each aspect of the FU affects the EF of the product, (ii) how to include this effect in the EF calculations and (iii) how an appropriate reference flow shall be calculated. In case calculation parameters are needed, the PEFCR shall provide default values or shall request these parameters in the list of mandatory company-specific information. The PEFCR shall provide a calculation example. Example The type of packaging might affect the amount of salad wasted at retail and at the use stage. As a consequence, the type of packaging affects the amount of salad which is needed to fulfil the \u2018how long\u2018 and \u2018how much\u2018 described in the FU. The PEFCR shall describe the potential effects of packaging on food waste and provide a table with the percentage of salad waste per packaging type used. Finally, the PEFCR shall describe how the percentage of salad waste from the table is integrated into the reference flow and added to the FU of 1kg of salad consumed. All quantitative input and output data collected in the analysis shall be calculated in relation to this reference flow of 1kg plus the percentage of waste. A.3.2.5.

List of EF impact categories The PEFCR shall list the 16 EF impact categoriesto be used to calculate the PEF profile, as listed in Table 2 of the Annex I. Out of the 16 impact categories, the PEFCR shall list those that are most relevant for the product category and/or sub-categories inscope (see section A.6.1.1of this AnnexII). The PEFCR shall specify if the user of the PEFCR shall calculate and report separately the sub-indicators for climate change (see section A.4.2.9). The PEFCR shall specify the version of the EF reference package to be used103. A.3.2.7. Additional information A.3.2.7.1. Additional environmental information The PEFCR shall specify which additional environmental information to report, and whether these are mandatory or recommended additional environmental information. The use of \u2018should\u2018 requirements should be avoided. Additional environmental information may be included only if the PEFCR specifies the method that shall be used for its calculation. Biodiversity When developing a PEFCR, biodiversity shall be addressed under additional environmental informationthrough the procedure below: (a) When performing the first and second PEF-RP study, the Technical Secretariat shall make an assessment about the relevance of biodiversity for the product (sub)category(s) in scope of the PEFCR. This assessment may be based onexpert judgement, be LCA-based, or be derived through other means already put in place within the sector covering the product group. The assessment shall be clearly explained in a dedicated section of the first and second PEF-RP report. 103 Available at http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developer.xhtm\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/325 (b) Based on the above, the PEFCR shall clearly explain whether biodiversity is considered relevant or not. If the Technical Secretariat determines that there are significant impacts on biodiversity, then they shall describe how the user of the PEFCR shall assess and report biodiversity impacts, as additional environmental information. While the Technical Secretariat may determine how biodiversity shall be assessed and reported in the PEFCR (if relevant), the following suggestions are available: 1. To express the(avoided) impact on biodiversity as the percentage of material that comes from ecosystems that have been managed to maintain or enhance conditions for biodiversity. This shall then be demonstrated by a regular monitoring and reporting of biodiversity levels, gains or losses (e.g. less than 15% loss of species richness due to disturbance, but the Technical Secretariat may set their own level provided this is well justified). The assessment should refer to materials that end up in the final products and to materials that have been used during the production process. For example, charcoal that is used in steel production processes, or soy that is used to feed cows that produce dairy etc. 2. To report additionally the percentage of such materials for which no chain of custody or traceability information can be found. 3. To use a certification system as a proxy. The Technical Secretariatshall determine which certification schemes provide sufficient evidence for ensuring biodiversity maintenance and describe the criteria used104. A.3.2.7.2. Additional technical information The PEFCR shall list the additional technical information that shall/ should/ may be reported. If the product in scope is an intermediate product, the PEFCR shall request the following additional technical information: 1. The biogenic carbon content at factory gate (physical content) shall be reported in the PEF study. If derived from a native forest, the PEFCR shall require that the corresponding carbon emissions shall be modelled with the elementary flow \u2018(land use change)\u2019; 2. The recycled content (R1) shall be reported; 3. Results with application-specific A-values of the circular footprint formula, if relevant. A.3.2.8.

Modelling requirements A.4.2.1. Agricultural production For agricultural activities, the modelling guidelines of section 4.4.1of the Annex Ishall be followed for the RPs and included in the PEFCRs. Any exception shall be agreed upon with the Commission before being implemented. A.4.2.1.1. Fertilisers For nitrogen-based fertilisers, the Tier 1 emissions factors of table 2-4 of IPCC (2006) should be used, as presented in Table 3 of the Annex I. The nitrogen field model presented in Table 3 of the Annex I has some limitations and should be improved in the future. Therefore, PEFCRs which have agricultural modelling in scope shall test (as aminimum) the following alternative approach within the PEF-RPs. The N-balance is calculated using the parameters in Table II-3and the formula below. The total NO-N emission 3 to water is considered a variable and its total inventory shall be calculated as: \u2018Total NO-N emission to water\u2018 = \u2018NO-base loss\u2018 + \u2018additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018, with 3 3 3 \u2018Additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018 = \u2018N input with all fertilisers\u2018 + \u2018N fixation by crop\u2018 \u2013 \u2018N- 3 2 removal with the harvest\u2018 \u2013\u2018NH emissions to air\u2018 \u2013\u2018NO emissions to air\u2018 \u2013\u2018N emissions to air\u2018 -\u2018NO- 3 2 2 3 base loss\u2018. If in certain low-input schemes the value for \u2018additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018 is negative, the value shall be 3 set to \u20180\u2018. Moreover, in such cases the absolute value of the calculated \u2018additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018 is to 3 be inventoried as additional N-fertiliser input into the system, using the same combination of N-fertilisers as employed to the analysed crop. This serves to avoid fertility-depleting schemes by capturing the N-depletion by the analysed crop that is assumed to lead to the need for additional fertiliser later on to keep the same soil fertility level.

A.4.2.2. Electricity use The requirements in section 4.4.2 of the Annex Ishall be applied, unless the PEFCR covers electricity as main product (e.g., photovoltaic systems). A.4.2.2.1. Electricity modelling for benchmark calculations In benchmark calculations the following electricity mix shall be used in hierarchical order: (i) Sector specific information on the use of green electricity shall be used if: (a) available, and (b) the set of minimum criteria to ensure the contractual instruments are reliable is met.This may be combined with the remaining electricity to be modelled with the residual grid mix. (ii) In case no sector specific information is available, the consumption grid mix shall be used. In case the benchmark is produced in different locations or sold in different countries, the electricity mix shall reflect the ratios of productionor ratios of sales between EU countries/regions. To determine the ratio, a physical unit shall be used (e.g. number of pieces or kg of product). Where such data are not available, the average EU mix (EU+EFTA), or region representative mix shall be used. A.4.2.3. Transport and logistics The PEFCR shall provide default transport scenarios to be used, in case these data are not listed as mandatory company-specific information (see section A.4.4.1) and supply-chain specific information is not available. The default transport scenarios shall reflect the European average transport, including all different transport options within the current product category (e.g. including home delivery, if applicable). In case no PEFCR-specific data105is available, the default scenarios and values outlined in section 4.4.3of the Annex Ishall be used. Replacement of the default values provided in section 4.4.3with PEFCR-specific values shall be clearly mentioned and justified in the PEFCR. The (final and intermediate) client of the product shall be defined in the PEFCR106. The final client may be a consumer (i.e. any natural person who is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business, craft or profession) or a company that uses the product for final use, such as restaurants, professional painters, or a construction site. For the purposes of this section, re-sellers and importers are intermediate clients and not final clients. A.4.2.3.1. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013truck transport The PEFCR shall specify the utilisation ratio to be used for each truck transport modelled, and it shall clearly indicate whether the utilisation ratio includes empty return trips. \u2022 If the load is mass-limited: a default utilisation ratio of 64%107shall be used.

In Germany only, the average truck load is 64%.\n\nL 471/328 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 \u2022 If the load is volume-limited and the full volume is used: the PEFCR shall indicate the company-specific utilisation ratio calculated as the kg real load/kg payload of the dataset and indicate how empty returns shall be modelled. \u2022 If the load is delicate (e.g. flowers): it is likely that the full truck volume cannot be used. The PEFCR shall evaluate the most appropriate utilisation ratio to be applied. \u2022 Bulk transport (e.g., gravel transport from mining pit to concrete plant) shall be modelled with a default utilisation ratio of 50% (100% loaded outbound and 0% loaded inbound). \u2022 Reusable products and packaging shall be modelled with PEFCR-specific utilisation ratios. The default value of 64% (including empty return) cannot be used because the return transport is modelled separately for reusable products. A.4.2.3.2. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013consumer transport The PEFCR shall prescribe thedefault allocation value to be used for consumer transport, if applicable. A.4.2.3.3. Default scenarios \u2013from supplier to factory The PEFCR shall specify default transport distances, transport modes (specific dataset) and truck load factors to be used for the transport of products from supplier to factory. If no PEFCR specific data are available, then the default data providedin section 4.4.3.4 of the Annex Ishall be prescribed in the PEFCR. A.4.2.3.4. Default scenarios \u2013from factory to final client The transport from factory to final client (including consumer transport) shall be described in the distribution stage of the PEFCR. This helps fair comparisons between products delivered through traditional shops as well as delivered at home. In case no PEFCR-specific transport scenario is available, the default scenario outlined in section 4.4.3.5of the Annex Ishall be used as a basis, together with a number of PEFCR-specific values: 1. Ratio between products sold through retail, distribution centre (DC) and directly to the final client; 2. For factory to final client: Ratio between local, intracontinental and international supply chains; 3. For factory to retail: distribution between intracontinental and international supply chains. For reusable products the return transport from retail/DC to factory shall be modelled in addition to the transport needed to go to retail/DC. The same transport distances as from product factory to final client shall be used (see section 4.4.3.5 of the Annex I), however the truck utilisation ratio might be volume-limited depending on the type of product. The PEFCR shall indicate the utilisation ratio that shall be used for the return transport. A.4.2.4. Capital goods \u2013infrastructure and equipment During the execution of the PEF-RP studies all processes shall be included in the modelling without applying any cut-off, the modelling assumptions and secondary datasets used shall be clearly documented. The PEFCR shall identify if, based on the results of the PEF-RP study, capital goods are subject to cut-off or not. If capital goods are included in the PEFCR, clear rules for their calculation shall be provided. A.4.2.5. Sampling procedure In some cases, a sampling procedure is needed by the user of a PEFCR to limit the data collection only to a representative sample of plants/ farms etc. Examples of cases when the sampling procedure may be needed are in case multiple production sites are involved in the production of the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU); e.g., in case the same raw material/ input material comes from multiple sites or in case the same process is outsourced to more than one subcontractor/ supplier.

For PEFCRs a stratified sample shall be used, i.e. one that ensures that sub-populations (strata) of a given population are each adequately represented within the whole sample of a research study. With this type of sampling, it is guaranteed that subjects from each sub-population are included in the final sample, whereas simple\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/329 random sampling does not ensure that sub-populations are represented equally or proportionately within the sample. The Technical Secretariat shall decide if sampling is allowed or not allowed in its PEFCR. The Technical Secretariat may explicitly prohibit the use of sampling procedures in the PEFCR. In this case sampling will not be allowed in PEF studies and the user of the PEFCR shall collect data from all plants or farms. If the Technical Secretariat allows sampling, the PEFCR shall contain the following sentence: \u2018In case sampling is needed, it shall be conducted as specified in this PEFCR. However, sampling is not mandatory and any user of this PEFCR may decide to collect the data from all the plants or farms, without performing any sampling.\u2018 In case the PEFCR allows the use of sampling, the PEFCR shall define the requirements for reporting by the user of the PEFCR. The population and the selected sample used for the PEF study shall be clearly described in the PEF report (e.g., the % of the total production or % of number of sites, following the requirements stated in the PEFCR). A.4.2.5.1. How to define homogeneous sub-populations (stratification) The PEF method requires aspects to be taken into consideration in the identification of the sub-populations (see section 4.4.6.1of the Annex I): 1. Geographical distribution of sites; 2. Technologies/ farming practices involved; 3. Production capacity of the companies/ sites taken into consideration. The PEFCR may list additional aspects to be taken into consideration within a specific product category. In case additional aspects are taken into account, the number of sub-populations is calculated using the formula (equation 1) provided in section 4.4.6.1 of the Annex I and multiplying the result with the numbers of classes identified for each additional aspect (e.g., those sites which have an environmental management or reporting systems in place). A.4.2.5.2. How to define sub-sample size at sub-population level The PEFCR shall specify the approach chosen among the two available in section 4.4.6.2 of the Annex I. The same approach shall be used for all the sub-populations selected. In case the first approach is chosen the PEFCR shall establish the unit of measure for the production (e.g., t, m3, m2or value in \u20ac). The PEFCR shall identify the percentage of production to be covered by each sub-population, which shall not be lower than 50%, expressed in the relevant unit. This percentage determines the sample size within the sub-population. A.4.2.6. Use stage A.4.2.6.1. Main function approach or delta approach The PEFCR shall describe which approach shall be applied (main function approach or delta approach, section 4.4.7.1 of the Annex I). In case the delta approach is used, the PEFCR shall specify a reference consumption to be defined for each associated product (e.g. of energy and materials). The reference consumption refers to the minimum consumption that is essential for providing the function. The consumption above this reference (the delta) will then be allocated to the product. To define the reference situation, the following shall be considered, if available: 1. Regulations applicable to the product category; 2. Standards or harmonised standards; 3. Recommendations from manufacturers or manufacturers\u2019 organisations; 4. Use agreements established by consensus in sector-specific working groups.\n\nL 471/330 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 A.4.2.6.2.

(b) The PEFCR shall identify for which processes default data shall be provided by following the modelling guidelines in Table JJ-4. In case modelling is optional, the Technical Secretariatshall decide whether this is included in the system boundary of the PEFCR calculation model. (c) Per process to be modelled, the Technical Secretariat shall decide and describe in the PEFCR whether the main function approach or delta approach shall be applied: a. Main function approach: The default datasets presented in the PEFCR shall reflect as much as possible the reality of market situations. b. Delta approach: the PEFCR shall provide the reference consumption to be used. (d) The PEFCR shall follow the modelling and reporting guidelines in Table JJ-4. This table shall be filled in by the Technical Secretariatand included in the first and second PEF-RP reports.

The use stage results shall not be reported as additional environmental or technical information. Part D of Annex II provides default data to be used by the Technical Secretariat to model use stage activities that might be cross-cutting for several product groups. It shall be used to fill in the data gaps and ensure consistency among PEFCRs. Better data may be used but shall be justified in the PEFCR. Example: pasta This is a simplified example on how the environmental footprint of the use stage can be modelled and reported for the product \u20181 kg dry pasta\u2019 (adapted from the final PEFCR for dry pasta108). Table LL-6presents the processes used for modelling the use stage of 1kg dry pasta (boiling time according to instructions, for instance 10 minutes; amount of water, according to the instructions, for instance 10 litres). Among the four processes, electricity and heat use are the most relevant ones. Within this example, all four processes are product dependent. The amount of water use and cooking time is in general indicated on the packaging. The manufacturer can change the recipe in order to increase or reduce the cooking time, and therefore the energy use. Within the PEFCR, default data is provided on all four processes, as indicated in Table LL-6(activity data + LCI 108 Available at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/PEFCR_OEFSR_en.htm\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/331 dataset to be used).

The B value to be used shall be clearly stated in the PEFCR. A.4.2.7.3. The quality ratios: Qs /Q and Qs /Q in p out p The quality ratios shall be determined at the point of substitution and per application or material. The quality ratios are PEFCR specific. For packaging, each PEFCR should use the default values provided in Part C of Annex II. The Technical Secretariat may decide to change the default values in the PEFCR to product category specific ones. In this case, the justification for the change shall be included in the PEFCR. All quality ratios to be used shall be clearly stated in the PEFCR. Alternatively, clear guidance shall be provided by the PEFCR on how to determine quality ratios to be used. The quantification of the quality ratios shall be based on: Economic aspects: i.e. price ratio of secondary compared to primary materials at the point of substitution. In case the price of secondary materials is higher than that of the primary ones, the quality ratios shall be equal to 1. If economic aspects are less relevant than physical aspects, the latter may be used. A.4.2.7.4. Recycled content (R1) The PEFCR shall provide the list of default R1 values, which shall be used by the user of the PEFCR in case no company-specific values are available. For this, the Technical Secretariat shall select the appropriate application- specific R1 values available in Part C of Annex II. In case no application-specific values are available, R1 shall be set equal to 0. Material-specific values based on supply market statistics shall not be used as a proxy. All possible geographic regions shall be provided. The appliedR1 values shall be subject to the PEFCR review (if applicable) or PEF study verification (if applicable).

Greenhouse gas emissions and removals To provide all necessary information for developing the PEFCR, the PEF-RP study shall always calculate the three climate change sub-categories separately. If climate change is identified as a most-relevant impact category, the PEFCR shall (i) request to report the total climate change as the sum of the three sub-categories, and (ii) request the reporting of the sub-categories \u2018climate change -fossil\u2019, \u2018climate change \u2013biogenic\u2019 and \u2018climate change -land use and land use change\u2019, separately if the PEF-RP study shows a contribution of more than 5%110each to the total score. A.4.2.9.1. Sub-category 2: Climate change \u2013biogenic The PEFCR shall specify if a simplified modelling approach shall be used when modelling the foreground emissions. 110 For example, if 'Climate change -biogenic' contributes with 7% (using absolute values) to the total climate change impact and 'Climate change \u2013land use and land use change' contributes with 3% to the total climate change impact. In that case, the total climate change impact and the 'Climate change \u2013biogenic' shall be reported.

In case of inclusion, the PEFCR shall specify how this shall be modeled and calculated, and which proof shall be provided. If legislation provides specific modelling requirements for the sector, it shall be modelled according to this legislation. A.4.2.10. Packaging European average packaging datasets shall be used in case the PEFCR does not request the use of company- specific data, no supplier-specific information is available or the packaging is not relevant. Although the default secondary datasets shall be listed in the PEFCR, for some multi-material packaging the PEFCR shall provide additional information to allow the user to perform a correct modelling. This is for example the case for beverage cartons and bag-in-box packaging: \u2022 Beverage cartons are made out of LDPE granulates and liquid packaging board, with or without aluminium foil. The amount of LDPE granulates, board and foil (also called the bill of material of beverage cartons) depends on the application of the beverage carton and shall be defined in the PEFCR if applicable (e.g. wine cartons, milk cartons). Beverage cartons shall be modelled by combining the PEFCR prescribed amounts of material datasets with the beverage carton conversion dataset. \u2022 Bag in box is made out of corrugated board and packaging film. If applicable, the PEFCR should define the amount of corrugated board, as well as the amount and type of packaging film. If this is not prescribed by the PEFCR, the user of the PEFCR shall use the default dataset for bag-in-box. A.4.3. Handling multi-functional processes Systems involving multi-functionality of processes shall be modelled in accordance with the decision hierarchy provided in section 4.5of Annex I. The PEFCR shall further specify multi-functionality solutions within the defined system boundary and, where appropriate, for upstream and downstream stages. If applicable, the PEFCR shall further provide specific factors to be used in the case of allocation solutions. All such multi-functionality solutions specified in the PEFCR shall be clearly justified with reference to the PEF multi-functionality solution hierarchy: (a) Where subdivision is applied, the PEFCR shall specify which processes are to be sub-divided and the principles that such subdivision should adhere to. (b) Where allocation by physical relationship is applied, the PEFCR shall specify the relevant underlying physical relationships that shall be considered and list the specific allocation values that shall be fixed for all studies using the PEFCR. (c) Where allocation by some other relationship is applied, the PEFCR shall specify this relationship and list the specific allocation values that shall be fixed for all studies using the PEFCR. A.4.3.1. Animal husbandry A.4.3.1.1. Allocation within the farm module Default values for each type of animal shall be provided in the PEFCR and used by PEF studies.

No change of allocation factors is allowed in PEF studies. A.4.3.1.3. Allocation within the slaughterhouse for cattle If allocation factors to subdivide the impact of the carcass among the different cuts are desired, they shall be defined in the relevant PEFCR. A.4.4. Data collection requirements and quality requirements The materiality principle One of the main features of the PEF method is the \u2018materiality\u2018 approach, i.e. focusing where it really matters.

Allocation within the slaughterhouse for cattle If allocation factors to subdivide the impact of the carcass among the different cuts are desired, they shall be defined in the relevant PEFCR. A.4.4. Data collection requirements and quality requirements The materiality principle One of the main features of the PEF method is the \u2018materiality\u2018 approach, i.e. focusing where it really matters. In the PEF context, the materiality approach is developed around two main areas: Impact categories, life cycle stages, processes and direct elementary flows: the PEFCR shall identify the most relevant ones. These are the environmental contributions on which companies, stakeholders, consumers, and policymakers should focus (see section 7.3of the Annex I); Data requirements: as the most relevant processes are those driving the environmental profile of a product, these shall be assessed by using data of higher quality compared to the less relevant processes, independently from where these processes happen in the life cycle of the product. Once the model(s) for the representative product(s) is developed, the Technical Secretariat shall address the following two questions with the PEF-RP studies: (a) Which are the processes for which company-specific information is mandatory? (b) Which are the processes that are driving the environmental profile of the product (most relevant processes)? A.4.4.1. List of mandatory company-specific data The list of mandatory company-specific data refers to the activity data, direct elementary flows and (unit) processes for which company-specific data shall be collected. This list defines the minimum data requirements to be fulfilled by the users of the PEFCR. The purpose is to avoid that a user without access to the relevant company-specific data is able to perform a PEF study and communicate its results by only applying default data and datasets. The PEFCR shall define the list of mandatory company-specific data For the selection of the mandatory company-specific data, the Technical Secretariat shall consider its relevance within the EF profile, the level of effort needed to collect these data (especially for SMEs) and the overall quantity of data / time required to collect all mandatory company-specific data and existing legal requirements defined in EU law on measuring certain emissions. For instance, in case specific EU ETS monitoring rules exist for the sector to which the product in scope of the PEFCR belongs, the PEFCR should refer to EU ETS quantification requirements as set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 for the processes and GHGs covered therein. In case of carbon capture and storage (CC), the requirements of Annex I prevail. This decision has, in particular, two consequences: (i) companies may perform a PEF study by only searching for these data and using default data for everything outside this list, while (ii) companies that don\u2019t have company- specific data for any of the listed data cannot calculate a PEFCR-compliant PEF profile of the product in scope. For each process for which company-specific data is mandatory the PEFCR shall provide the following information: 1. the list of the company-specific activity data to be declared by the user of the PEFCR together with the default secondary datasets to be used. The list of activity data shall be as specific as possible in terms of units of measure and any other characteristics that could help the user in implementing the PEFCR; 2. the list of direct (i.e. foreground) elementary flows to be measured by the user of the PEFCR. This is the list of most relevant direct emissions and resources. For each emission and resourceflow, the PEFCR shall specify the frequency of measurements, the measurement methods and any other technical information necessary to ensure that PEF profiles are comparable.Note that the direct elementary flows\n\nL 471/338 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 listed shall be aligned with the nomenclature used by the most recent version of the EF reference package111. Considering that the data forthese processes shall be company-specific, the score of P cannot be higher than 3, the score for TiR, TeR, and GeR cannot be higher than 2, and the DQR score shall be equal or lower than 1.5 (\u22641.5). To assess the DQR, follow the requirements of Table 23 of Annex I. The developed datasets shall be EF compliant. For processes selected to be modelled mandatorily with company-specific data, the PEFCR shall follow the requirements set out in this section. For all other processes, the user of the PEFCR shall apply the Data Needs Matrix as explained in section 4.4.4.4of this Annex. A.4.4.2.

Datasets to be used When developing the final PEFCR, EF compliant datasets112shall be used. In case EF compliant datasets are not available, the following rules shall be followed in hierarchical order: 1. An EF compliant proxy is available for free: it shall be included in the list of default processes of the PEFCR and stated within the limitations sectionof the PEFCR. 2. An ILCD-EL compliant dataset as proxy is available for free: A maximum of 10% of the single overall score may be derived from ILCD-EL compliant datasets. 3. If no EF compliant or ILCD-EL compliant dataset is available for free: it shall be excluded from the model. This shall be clearly stated in the PEFCR as a data gap and validated by the PEFCR reviewers. For the user of the PEFCR, the secondary datasets listed in the PEFCR shall be used. Whenever a dataset needed to calculate the PEF profile is not among those listed, the following rules shall be followed in hierarchical order: 1. Use an EF compliant dataset available on one of the nodes of the Life Cycle Data Network113; 2. Use an EF compliant dataset available in a free or commercial source; 3. Use another EF compliant dataset considered to be a good proxy. In this case,this information shall be included in the \u2018limitations\u2018 section of the Annex I. 4. Use an ILCD-EL compliant dataset as proxy. In such cases, these datasets shall be included in the \u2018limitations\u2018 section of the Annex I. This up to a imaximum contribution of 10% of the single overall score of the product in scope 5. If no EF compliant or ILCD-EL compliant dataset is available: it shall be excluded from the PEF study. This shall be clearly stated in the PEF report as a data gap and validated by the PEF study and PEF report verifiers. Whenever anEF orILCD-EL compliant dataset is used, the nomenclature of the elementary flows shall be aligned with the EF reference package used in the rest of the model114. A.4.4.3. Cut-off Any cut-off shall be avoided in the first PEF-RP study and supporting studies. Based on the results of the first PEF-RP study and if confirmed by the supporting study results, the second PEF- RP study and PEFCR may exclude processes from the RP system boundaries by applying the following rule: (a) In case processes are excluded from the model, this shall be done based on a 3% cut-off considering their environmental impact for all impact categories, additionally to the cut-off already included in the background datasets. This rule is valid for both intermediate and final products. The processes that in total (cumulatively) account less than 3% of the environmental impact for each impact category may be excluded from the RP. In case the Technical Secretariat decides to apply the cut-off rule, second PEF-RP shall exclude the processes and the PEFCR shall list the processes that shall be excluded based on the cut-off. 111 Available at http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 112 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/contactListEF.xhtml 113 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/ 114 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/339 (b) In case the processes identified for cut-off from the first PEF-RP study are not confirmed by the supporting studies, the decision about their exclusion or inclusion shall be left to the review panel and reported explicitly in the review report to be annexed to the PEFCR.

The DQR formula The PEFCR shall provide tables with the criteria to be used for the semi-quantitative assessment of each data quality criteria. The PEFCR may specify more stringent or specify additional data quality requirements if appropriate for the sector in question. A.4.4.4.2. The DQR of company-specific datasets When creating a company-specific dataset, the data quality of i) the company-specific activity data and ii) the company-specific direct elementary flows (i.e. emission data) shall be assessed separately by the user of the PEFCR. To allow the evaluation of the DQR of data sets with company-specific data, the PEFCR shall include at least one table on how to assess the value of the DQR criteria for these processes. The table(s) to be included in the PEFCR shall be based on Table 23 of Annex I: only the reference years criteria (Ti , Ti ) may be adapted R-EF R-AD by the Technical Secretariat. The DQR of the sub-processes linked to the activity data (see Figure 9 of theAnnex I) are evaluated through the requirements provided in the DNM(section A.4.4.4.4of this Annex). The DQR of the newly developed dataset shall be calculated as follows: (a) Select the most relevant activity data and direct elementary flows: most relevant activity data are the ones linked to sub-processes (i.e. secondary datasets) that account for at least 80% of the total environmental impact of the company-specific dataset, listing them from the most contributing to the least contributing one. Most relevant direct elementary flows are defined as those direct elementary flows contributing cumulatively at least with 80% to the total impact of the direct elementary flows. (d) Calculate the DQR criteria TeR, TiR, GeR and P for each most relevant activity data and each most relevant direct elementary flow. The values of each criteria shall be assigned based on the table on how to assess the value of the DQR criteria provided in the PEFCR. a. Each most relevant direct elementary flow consists of the amount and elementary flow naming (e.g. 40 g carbon dioxide). For each most relevant elementary flow, the user of the PEFCR shall evaluate the 4 DQR criteria named TeR-EF, TiR-EF, GeR-EF, PEF. Examples of elements to be evaluated include the timing of the flow measured, the technology for which the flow was measured and in which geographical area the measurement was made. b. For each most relevant activity data, the 4 DQR criteria shall be evaluated (named TeR-AD,TiR- AD, PAD, GeR-AD,) by the user of the PEFCR. c. Considering that the data for the mandatory processes shall be company-specific, the score of P cannot be higher than 3 while the score for TiR, TeR, and GeR cannot be higher than 2 (The DQR score shall be \u22641.5). (e) Calculate the environmental contribution of each most-relevant activity data (through linking to the appropriate sub-process) and each most-relevant direct elementary flow to the total sum of the environmental impact of all most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows, in % (weighted, using all EF impact categories). For example, the newly developed dataset has only two most relevant activity data, contributing in total to 80% of the total environmental impact of the dataset: a. Activity data 1 carries 30% of the total dataset environmental impact. The contribution of this process to the total of 80% is 37.5% (the latter is the weight to be used).\n\nL 471/340 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 b. data 2 carries 50% of the total dataset environmental impact.

(f) Calculate the TeR, TiR, GeR and P criteria of the newly developed dataset as the weighted average of each criterion of the most relevant activity data and direct elementary flows. The weight is the relative contribution (in %) of each most relevant activitydata and direct elementary flow calculated in step (3).

It is not allowed to modify the text for the other criteria. A.4.4.4.4. The Data Needs Matrix All processes required to model the product and that are not on the list of mandatory company-specific data shall be evaluated using the Data Needs Matrix (seeTable MM-8). Rules to be followed when developing a PEFCR The PEFCR shall include the following information for all processes that are not on the list of mandatory company- specific data: (1) provide the list of default secondary datasets to be used within the scope of the PEFCR (dataset name, together with the UUID of the aggregated version115, the web address of the node, and the data stocks).

This list shall be as specific as possible in terms of unit of measurement,how to measure oraverage data,and any other characteristics that could help the user in implementing the PEFCR. Rules for the user of the PEFCR The user of the PEFCR shall apply the DNM to evaluate which data is needed. It shall be used within the modelling of its PEF study, depending on the level of influence the user (company) has on the specific process.

Benchmark The benchmark shall be provided for each RP and shall correspond to the PEF profile of the second PEF-RP modelled after the supporting studies results are taken into consideration. The PEFCR shall provide the results of the benchmark for each RP as characterised, normalised and weighted results for each of the EF impact categories (not only the most relevant ones) and as a single overall score based on the weighting factors provided in section 5.2.2of Annex I, each in a different table.Results shall be provided for (i) the total life cycle, and (ii) the total life cycle excluding the use stage. Benchmarking may be excluded for intermediate products. The reporting of the characterised, normalised and weighted results calculated for each intermediate RP is optional in the PEFCR, but mandatory in the PEF study and PEF report. A.5.2. Classes of performance The identification of classes of performance is not obligatory. Each Technical Secretariat is free to define a method to identify the classes of performance, in case they deem it appropriate and relevant. The procedure described below is provided only as an example. In this procedure 5 classes of performance are identified, from category A being the best class with lowest environmental impact, up to category E being the worst class with the highest impact. The classes of performance are identified at the level of the single overall scoreof all 16 EF impact categories (see section 5.2.2of Annex I).\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/345 First, the single overall score of the representative product (BM, calculated from the second PEF-RP) represents the midpoint of class C. Second, the upper limit and lower limit of the lowest category A and highest category E are identified through a sensitivity analysis on the model of the RP (on each representative product if there are multiple). The sensitivity analysis will identify the most relevant parameters contributing to the single overall score. Once these parameters are identified, based on industry data provided by the Technical Secretariat members, the theoretical best product (calculated by assigning the best technically feasible value for each parameter) and the theoretical worst product (calculated by assigning the worst technically value for each parameter) are identified. They help to define the upper limit of category A (OS-BP) and lower limit of category E (OS-WP). Once the two extremes and the midpoint of class C are identified, the remaining limits of the different categories are identified according to the table below: Table NN-9Establishing the limits of performance classes Category Class of performance boundaries A OS < BP+(BM-BP)*0.30 B BP+(BM-BP)*0.30 \u2264 OS < BP+(BM-BP)*0.85 C BP+(BM-BP)*0.85 \u2264 OS < WP+(BM-WP)*0.85 D WP+(BM-WP)*0.85 \u2264 OS < WP+(BM-WP)*0.30 E OS \u2265 WP+(BM-WP)*0.30 where OS-BPis the single overall score of the best product, OS-WPis the single overall score of the worst product, BMis the single overall score of the representative product (benchmark value), OSis the single overall score of a specific product calculated based on a PEF study carried out in compliance with the PEFCR.

A.6.1.1. Procedure to identify the most relevant impact categories The identification of the most relevant impact categories shall follow the requirements at section 6.3.1of Annex I. The PEFCR may add more impact categories to the list of the most relevant ones but none shall be deleted. A.6.1.2. Procedure to identify the most relevant life cycle stages The identification of the most relevant life cycle stages shall follow the requirements in section6.3.2of Annex I. The Technical Secretariatmay decide to split or add additional life cycle stages if there are good reasons for it. This shall be justified in the PEFCR. E.g., the life cycle stage \u2018Raw material acquisition and pre-processing\u2019 may be split into \u2018Raw material acquisition\u2019, \u2018pre-processing\u2019, and \u2018raw materials supplier transport\u2019. A.6.1.3. Procedure to identify the most relevant processes The identification of the most relevant processes shall follow the requirements in section 6.3.3 of Annex I. The PEFCR may add more processes to the list of the most relevant ones but none shall be deleted. In most cases, vertically aggregated datasets may be identified as representing relevant processes. In such cases, it may not be obvious which process is responsible for contributing to an impact category. The Technical Secretariat may decide whether to seek further disaggregated data or to treat the aggregated dataset as a process for the purposes of identifying relevance. A.6.1.4. Procedure to identify the most relevant direct elementary flows The identification of the most relevant direct elementary flows shall follow the requirements at 6.3.4of Annex I. The Technical Secretariatmay add more elementary flows to the list of the most relevant ones but none shall be deleted. For each most relevantprocess, the identification of the most relevant direct elementary flows is important to define which direct emissions or resource use should be requested as company-specific data (i.e. the foreground elementary flows within the processes listed in the PEFCR as mandatory company-specific data). A.7.PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REPORTS General requirements regarding PEF reports are available in Annex I(section 8). Any PEF study (including PEF- RP studies and supporting studies) shall include a PEF report.

The next sections provide tables with the criteria to be used for the semi-quantitative assessment of each criterion. [The PEFCR may specify more stringent data quality requirements and specify additional criteria for the assessment of data quality. The PEFCR shall report the formulas to be used for assessing the DQR of i) company- specific data (equation 20 of Annex I), ii) secondary datasets (equation 19 of Annex I), iii) PEF study (equation 20 of Annex I).] 127 Unless specific measurement methods are foreseen in a country-specific legislation\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/361 B.5.3.1. Company-specific datasets The DQR shall be calculated at the level-1 disaggregation, before any aggregation of sub-processes or elementary flows is performed. The DQR of company-specific datasets shall be calculated as following: 1) Select the most relevant activity data and direct elementary flows: most relevant activity data are the ones linked to sub-processes (i.e. secondary datasets) that account for at least 80% of the total environmental impact of the company-specific dataset, listing them from the most contributing to the least contributing one. Most relevant direct elementary flows are defined as those direct elementary flows contributing cumulatively at least with 80% to the total impact of the direct elementary flows. 2) Calculate the DQR criteria TeR, TiR, GeR and P for each most relevant activity data and each most relevant direct elementary flow. The values of each criterion shall be assigned based on Table B.9. a. Each most relevant direct elementary flow consists of the amount and elementary flow naming (e.g. 40 g carbon dioxide). For each most relevant elementary flow, the user of the PEFCR shall evaluate the 4 DQR criteria named TeR , TiR , GeR , P . For example, the user of the -EF -EF -EF EF PEFCR shall evaluate the timing of the flow measured, for which technology the flow was measured and in which geographical area. b. For each most relevant activitydata, the 4 DQR criteria shall be evaluated (named TR TiR e -AD - , GeR , P )by the user of the PEFCR. AD -AD AD c. Considering that the data for the mandatory processes shall be company-specific, the score of P cannot be higher than 3, while the score for TiR, TeR, and GeR cannot be higher than 2 (The DQR score shall be \u22641.5). 3) Calculate the environmental contribution of each most relevant activity data (through linking to the appropriate sub-process) and each most relevant direct elementary flow to the total sum of the environmental impact of all most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows, in % (weighted, using all EF impact categories). For example, the newly developed dataset has only two most relevant activity data, contributing in total to 80% of the total environmental impact of the dataset: a. Activity data 1 carries 30% of the total dataset environmental impact. The contribution of this process to the total of 80% is 37.5% (the latter is the weight to be used). b. Activity data 2 carries 50% of the total dataset environmental impact. The contribution of this process to the total of 80% is 62.5% (the latter is the weight to be used). 4) Calculate the TeR, TiR, GeR and P criteria of the newly developed dataset as the weighted average of each criteria of the most relevant activity data and direct elementary flows. The weight is the relative contribution (in %) of each most relevant activity data and direct elementary flow calculated in step 3. 5) The user of the PEFCR shall calculate the total DQR of the newly developed dataset using Equation B.2, where are the weighted average calculated as specified in point (4).

Electricity modelling The following electricity mix shall be used in hierarchical order: (a) Supplier-specific electricity product shall be used iffor a country there is a 100% tracking system in place, or if : (i) available, and (ii) the set of minimum criteria to ensure the contractual instruments are reliable is met. (b) The supplier-specific total electricity mix shall be used if: (i) available, and (ii) the set of minimum criteria to ensure the contractual instruments are reliable is met. (c) The \u2018country-specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019 shall be used. Country-specific means the country in which the life cycle stage or activity occurs. This may be an EU country or non-EU country. The residual grid mix prevents double counting with the use of supplier-specific electricity mixes in (a) and (b). (d) As a last option, the average EU residual grid mix, consumption mix (EU+EFTA), or region representative residual grid mix, consumption mix, shall be used. Note: for the use stage, the consumption grid mix shall be used. The environmental integrity of the use of supplier-specific electricity mix depends on ensuring that contractual instruments (for tracking) reliably and uniquely convey claims to consumers. Without this, the PEF lacks the accuracy and consistency necessary to drive product/ corporate electricity procurement decisions and accurate consumer (buyer of electricity) claims. Therefore, a set of minimum criteria that relate to the integrity of the contractual instruments as reliable conveyers of environmental footprint information has been identified. They represent the minimum features necessary to use supplier-specific mix within PEF studies. Set of minimum criteria to ensure contractual instruments from suppliers A supplier-specific electricity product/ mix may only be used if the user of the PEF method ensures that the contractual instrument meets the criteria specified below. If contractual instruments do not meet the criteria, then country-specific residual electricity consumption-mix shall be used in the modelling.

If no suitable dataset is available, the following approach should be used: Determine the country consumption mix (e.g.X% of MWh produced with hydro energy, Y% of MWh produced with coal power plant) and combine them with LCI datasets per energy type and country/region (e.g. LCI dataset for the production of 1MWh hydro energy in Switzerland): Activity data related to non-EU country consumption mix per detailed energy type shall be determined based on: 1) Domestic production mix per production technologies; 2) Import quantity and from which neighbouring countries; 3) Transmission losses; 4) Distribution losses; 5) Type of fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and / or domestic supply). These data may be found in the publications of the International Energy Agency (IEA (www.iea.org). Available LCI datasets per fuel technologies. The LCI datasets available are generally specific to a country or a region in terms of: 1) fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and/ or domestic supply); 2) energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy contents); 3) technology standards of power plants regarding efficiency, firing technology, flue-gas desulphurisation, NOx removal and de-dusting. Allocation rules: [The PEFCR shall define which physical relationship shall be used by PEF studies: (i) to subdivide the electricity consumption among multiple products for each process (e.g. mass, number ofpieces, volume\u2026) and (ii) to reflect the ratios of production/ratios of sales between EU countries/regions when a product is produced in different locations or sold in different countries.

An example is the 100% allocation of a greener electricity mix to a specific product. On-site electricity generation: If on-site electricity production is equal to the site own consumption, two situations apply: 1) No contractual instruments have been sold to a third party: the own electricity mix (combined with LCI datasets) shall be modelled. 2) Contractual instruments have been sold to a third party: the \u2018country-specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019 (combined with LCI datasets) shall be used.

Subdivision applies both to separate electricity productions or to a common electricity production where you may allocate based on electricity amounts the upstream and direct emissions to your own consumption and to the share you sell out of your company (e.g. ifa company has a windmill on its production site and exports 30% of the produced electricity, emissions related to 70% of produced electricity should be accounted in the PEF study). 2) If not possible, direct substitution shall be used. The country-specific residual consumption electricity mix shall be used as substitution134. Subdivision is considered as not possible when upstream impacts or direct emissions are closely related to the product itself. B.5.9.

Climate change \u2013 biogenic: This sub-category covers carbon emissions to air (CO2, CO and CH4) originating from the oxidation and/or reduction of biomass by means of its transformation or degradation (e.g. combustion, digestion, composting, landfilling) and CO uptake from the atmosphere 2 through photosynthesis during biomass growth \u2013i.e. corresponding to the carbon content of products, biofuels or aboveground plant residues, such as litter and dead wood.

PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011): \u2018Large emissions of GHGs can result as a consequence of land use change. Removals as a direct result of land use change (and not as a result of long-term management practices) do not usually occur, although it is recognized that this could happen in specific circumstances. Examples of direct land use change are the conversion of land used for growing crops to industrial use or conversion from forestland to cropland. All forms of land use change that result in emissions or removals are to be included. Indirect land use change refers to such conversions of land use as a consequence of changes in land use elsewhere. While GHG emissions also arise from indirect land use change, the methods and data requirements for calculating these emissions are not fully developed. Therefore, the assessment of emissions arising from indirect land use change is not included.

Averaging over three years may best be done by first gathering annual data and calculating the life cycleinventory per year and then determining the three years average. Pesticide emissions shall be modelled as specific active ingredients. As a default approach, pesticides applied on the field shall be modelled as 90% emitted to the agricultural soil compartment, 9% emitted to air and 1% emitted to water. Fertiliser (and manure) emissions shall be differentiated per fertilizer type and cover as a minimum: 1) NH3, to air (from N-fertiliser application) 2) N2O, to air (direct and indirect) (from N-fertiliser application) 3) CO2, to air (from lime, urea and urea-compounds application) 4) NO3, to water unspecified (leaching from N-fertiliser application) 5) PO4, to water unspecified or freshwater (leaching and run-off of soluble phosphate from P-fertiliser application) 6) P, to water unspecified or freshwater (soil particles containing phosphorous, from P-fertiliser application). The LCI for P emissions should be modelled as the amount of P emitted to water after run-off and the emission compartment \u2018water\u2019 shall be used. When this amount is not available, the LCI may be modelled as the amount of P applied on the agricultural field (through manure or fertilisers) and the emission compartment 'soil' shall be used. In this case, the run-off from soil to water is part of the impact assessment method. The LCI for N emissions shall be modelled as the amount of emissions after it leaves the field (soil) and ending up in the different air and water compartments per amount of fertilisers applied. N emissions to soil shall not be modelled. The nitrogen emissions shall be calculated from nitrogen applications of the farmer on the field and excluding external sources (e.g. rain deposition). [For nitrogen based fertilisers, the PEFCR shall describe the LCI model to be used. The Tier 1 emission factors of IPCC (2006) should be used. A more comprehensive nitrogen field model may be used by the PEFCR provided (i) it covers at least the emissions requested above, (ii) N is balanced in inputs and outputs and (iii) it is described in a transparent way.] Table B. 16.

Heavy metal emissions from field inputs shall be modelled as emission to soil and/or leaching or erosion to water. The inventory to water shall specify the oxidation state of the metal (e.g., Cr+3, Cr+6). As crops assimilate part of the heavy metal emissions during their cultivation, clarification is needed on how to model crops that act as a sink. The following modelling approach shall be used: [The TS shall select one of the two modelling approaches to be used] 1) The final fate of the heavy metals elementary flows are not further considered within the system boundary: the inventory does not account for the final emissions of the heavy metals and therefore shall not account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. For example, heavy metals in agricultural crops cultivated for human consumption end up in the plant. Within the EF context human consumption is not modelled, the final fate is not further modelled and the plant acts as a heavy metal sink. Therefore, the uptake of heavy metals by the crop shall not be modelled. 2) The final fate (emission compartment) of the heavy metal elementary flows is considered within the system boundary: the inventory does account for the final emissions (release) of the heavy metals in the environment and therefore shall also account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. For example, heavy metals in agricultural crops cultivated for feed will mainly end up in the animal digestion and used as manure back on the field where the metals are released in the environment and their impacts are captured by the impact assessment methods. Therefore, the inventory of the agricultural stage shall account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. A limited amount ends up in the animal, which may be neglected for simplification. Methane emissions from rice cultivation shall be included on basis of IPCC (2006) calculation rules. Drained peat soils shall include carbon dioxide emissions on the basis of a model that relates the drainage levels to annual carbon oxidation.

Life-cycle inventory (LCI) - the combined set of exchanges of elementary, waste and product flows in a LCI dataset. Life-cycleinventory (LCI) dataset-adocumentor file with life-cycleinformation of a specified product or other reference (e.g., site, process), covering descriptive metadata and quantitative life-cycleinventory.

Multi-functionality \u2013if a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\u2018co-products\u2019), then it is \u2018multifunctional\u2018. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process will be partitionedbetween the product of interest and the other co-products according to clearly stated procedures. Non-elementary (or complex) flows \u2013 in the life-cycleinventory, non-elementary flows include all the inputs (e.g. electricity, materials, transport processes) and outputs (e.g. waste, by-products) in a system that need further modelling efforts to be transformed into elementary flows.

Organisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rules (OEFSRs) The primary objective of an OEFSR is to fix a consistent and specific set of rules for calculating the relevant environmental information of products belonging to the sector category in scope. An important objective is to focus on what matters most for a specific product category to make OEFstudies easier, faster and less costly. An equally important objective is to enable comparisons and comparative assertions i) between organisations or production sites within a same sector, or ii) of the performance of a single organisation or production site throughout time (see part A of the Annex IV for further details) Comparisons and comparative assertions are allowed only if OEF studies are conducted in compliance with an OEFSR. The product portfolios of different organisations or production sites, or of a same organisation over different reporting years, are usually different (e.g. in terms of amounts of products included), therefore the OEFSR shall provide guidance on how to ensure comparability, for example by normalizing the results of OEF studies against an appropriate reference system (e.g. yearly turnover) AnOEFstudy shall be conducted in compliance with anOEFSR, if anOEFSRis available for the portfolio of productsor sector in scope. Requirements for developing OEFSRs are specified in part A of Annex IV. An OEFSR may further specify requirements made in the OEFmethod and add new requirements ifthe OEFmethod leaves more than one choice. The objective is to ensure that OEFSRs are developed according to the OEF method and that they provide the specifications needed to achieve the comparability, increased reproducibility, consistency, relevance, focus and efficiency of OEFstudies. OEFSRs should, as far as possible, and recognising the different application contexts, be compliantwith existing relevant international sector rules and with ProductEnvironmental FootprintCategory Rules (PEFCRs) these are to be listed and evaluated. They maybe used as a basis for developing an OEFSR, in line with the requirements provided in part A of Annex IV. 1.1. Approach and examples for potential applications The rules provided in the OEFmethod enable practitioners to conduct OEFstudies that are more reproducible, consistent, robust, verifiable and comparable. The results of OEF studies are the basis for the provision of EF information and they may be used in a diverse number of potential fields of applications. Applications of OEFstudies without an existing OEFSRfor the portfolio of product(s) in scope will include: 1) In-house applications a) supportingto environmental management, b) identifyingenvironmental hotspots, c) environmental performance improvement and tracking, d) optimisingprocesses along the supply chain, 2) External applications: (e.g. business to business (B2B), business to consumer (B2C)): a) responding to investors\u2019 information requests b) sustainability or environmental reports c) marketing, d) responding to requirements of environmental policies at EU level or at the level of the individual Member States, e) participating in 3rd party schemes related to environmental claims or giving visibility to products that calculate and communicate their life-cycleenvironmental performance.

(2) Completeness Quantification of the OEF shall include all environmentally relevant material/energy flows and other environmental interventions as required for adherence to the defined system boundary, the data requirements, and the impact assessment methods employed. (3) Consistency Strict conformity to this method shall be observed in all steps of the OEFstudy to ensure internal consistency and comparability. (4) Accuracy All reasonable effort shall be taken to reduce uncertainties in product system modelling and the reporting of results. (5) Transparency OEFinformation shall be disclosed in such a way as to provide intended users with the necessary basis for decision- making, and for stakeholders to assess its robustness and reliability. 2.3. Phases of an Organisation Environmental Footprint study A number of phases shall be completed in carrying out anOEFstudy in line with this method -i.e. goal definition, scope definition, life-cycleinventory(LCI), life-cycleimpact assessment(LCIA), interpretation of OEFresults and OEFreporting \u2013see Figure 2.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/421 Figure 2Phases of anOrganisationEnvironmental Footprintstudy Define the goal and scope of the Organisation Environmental Footprint Compile the Life-cycle Inventory (LCI) EF Verification Conduct Life-cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) Life-cycle Interpretation and EF reporting In the goaldefinitionphase, the aims of the study are defined, namely the intended application, the reasons for carrying out the study and the intended audience. In the scope definition phase, the main methodological choices are made, for example the exact definition of the reporting unit, identifying the system boundary, selecting additional environmental and technical information, and the main assumptions and limitations. The LCI phase involves data collection and the calculation procedure for quantifyingof inputs and outputs of the studied system. Inputs and outputs concern energy, raw material and other physical inputs, products and co- products and waste, and emissions to air/water/soil. Data collected concern foreground processes and background processes. Data are put in relationship to the process units and reporting unit. The LCI is an iterative process.

The LCI phase involves data collection and the calculation procedure for quantifyingof inputs and outputs of the studied system. Inputs and outputs concern energy, raw material and other physical inputs, products and co- products and waste, and emissions to air/water/soil. Data collected concern foreground processes and background processes. Data are put in relationship to the process units and reporting unit. The LCI is an iterative process. In fact, as data are collected and more is learned about the system, new data requirements or limitations may be identified that require a change in the data collection procedures so that the goals of the study will still be met. In the impact assessment phase, LCI results are associated with environmental impact categories and indicators. This is done through LCIAmethods, which first classify emissions into impact categoriesand then characterise them ascommon units (e.g. CO and CH emissions are both expressed in CO equivalent emissions by using their 2 4 2 global warming potential). Examples of impact categories are climate change, acidification or resource use. In the interpretation phase, results from LCI and LCIA are interpreted in accordance withthe stated goal and scope. In this phase, most-relevant impact categories, life-cycle stages, processes and elementary flows are identified. Conclusions and recommendations can be drawn, based on the analytical results. It also includes the reporting step designedto summarise the results of the OEFstudy in the OEFreport. Finally, duringthe verification phase,a conformity assessment process is carried out to check whether the OEF study has been carried out in compliance with the present OEFmethod. The verification is mandatory whenever the OEFstudy, or part of the information init, is used for any type of external communication.\n\nL 471/422 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 3. Defining the goal(s) and scope of the Organisation Environmental Footprint study 3.1. Goal definition Goal definition is the first step of anOEFstudy, and sets the overall context for the study. The purpose of clearly defining goals is to ensure that the aims, methods, results and intended applications are aligned, and that a shared vision is in place to guide participants in the study. The decision to use the OEFmethod implies that some aspects of the goal definition will be decided a priori, due to the specific requirements provided by the OEFmethod. In defining goals, it is important to identify the intended applications and the degree of analytical depth andrigour of the study. This shallbe reflected in the defined study limitations (scope definition phase). The goal definition for anOEFstudy shall include: 1. Intended application(s); 2. Reasons for carrying out the study and decision context; 3. Target audience; 4. Commissioner of the study; 5. Identity of the verifier.

Scope definition The scope of the OEFstudy describes in detail the system to be evaluated and the technical specifications. The scope definition shall be in line with the defined goals of the study and shall include (see subsequent Sections for a more detailed description): 1. Definition of the reporting unit (RU): description of the organisation and the product portfolio (suite and the amounts of goods/services provided over the reporting interval); 2. System boundary (OEF boundary and organisational boundary); 3. EF impact categories12; 4. Additional information to be included; 12 The term \u201cEF impact category\u201d will be used throughout this method in place of the term \u201cimpact category\u201d used in EN ISO 14044:2006.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/423 5. Assumptions/limitations. 3.2.1 Reporting unit: organisation and product portfolio The organisation is the reference unit for the analysis and, along with the product portfolio, the basis for defining the reporting unit (RU). It is parallel to the concept of \u201cfunctional unit\u201d in a traditional Life-cycle Assessment (LCA)13 In the most general sense, the overarching function of the organisation, for the purposeof calculating the OEF, is the provision of goods and services over a specified", "embedding_index": 167}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_168", "text": " Assumptions/limitations. 3.2.1 Reporting unit: organisation and product portfolio The organisation is the reference unit for the analysis and, along with the product portfolio, the basis for defining the reporting unit (RU). It is parallel to the concept of \u201cfunctional unit\u201d in a traditional Life-cycle Assessment (LCA)13 In the most general sense, the overarching function of the organisation, for the purposeof calculating the OEF, is the provision of goods and services over a specified reporting interval. The reporting interval should be one year. Deviations from this reporting interval shall be justified. The product portfolio (PP)refers to the amount and nature of goods and services provided by the organisation over the reporting interval. The OEF may be limited to a clearly defined subset of the product portfolio of the organisation: a typical example is an organisation that is operating in various sectors and decides to restrict its analysis to one sector. The OEF study shall justify and report whether it is limited to a subset of its product portfolio. The RU for an OEF study shall be defined according to the following aspects: i) Definition of the organisation: a. Name of the organisation; b. The kinds of goods/services the organisation produces (i.e. the sector); c. Locations of operation (e.g. countries, cities); ii) Definition of the product portfolio: a. The good(s)/service(s) provided: \u2018what\u2019; b. The extent of the good or service: \u2018how much\u2019; c. The expected level of quality: \u2018how well\u2019; d. The duration/ lifetime of the good(s)/ service(s): \u2019how long\u2019; iii) The reference year; iv) The reporting interval Example Definition of the organisation: Organisation: Y Company Ltd. Goods/services sector: garment manufacturer Location(s): Paris, Berlin, Milan NACE code(s): 14 Definition of the Product Portfolio: What:T-shirts and trousers14 How much: 40,000 T-shirts, 20,000 trousers How well:Wear once per week and use washing machineat 30 degrees for cleaning once weekly; the energy use of the washing machine equals 0.72 MJ/kg clothing and the water use 10 litres/kg clothing for one wash cycle. One T-shirt weighs 0.16 kg and one pair of trousers weighs 0.53 kg. This results in an energy use of 0.4968 MJ/week and water consumption of 6.9 litres/week. How long: use stage of 5 years for both the T-shirts and the trousers. Reference year: 2017 13 Life-cycle assessment \u2013compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life-cycle (EN ISO 14040:2006) 14In OEF studies wider grouping of products is also possible (e.g. shoes, outer garment, etc), if that fits with the PP of the organisation.\n\nL 471/424 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 Reporting interval: one year. If the product portfolio is constituted by intermediate products, some aspects of the PP (i.e. how well and how long) are more difficult to define: if justification is provided, they may be omitted. . 3.2.2. System boundary The system boundary defines which parts of the PP and which associated life-cyclestages and processes belong to the analysed system, except for those processes excluded based on the cut-off rule (see Section 4.6.4). The reason for andpotential significance of any exclusion shall be justified and documented. The system boundary shall be defined following a general supply-chain logic, with reference to the products/ services included in the PP, including all stages from raw material acquisition and pre-processing, production, distribution andstorage, use stage and end of life. The co-products, by-products and waste streams of at least the foreground system shall be clearly identified. Two levels of system boundary definition are necessary for the OEF study: organisational boundary (in relation to the defined organisation); o OEF boundary (that specify upstream and downstream processes are included in the analysis). o 3.2.2.1 Organisational boundary The organisational boundary is defined so as to encompassall facilities and associated processes that are fully or partially owned and/or operated by the organisation and that directly contribute to the provision of the PP. The activities and impacts linked to processes within the defined organisational boundary are considered \u2018direct\u2019 activities and impacts. For example, in the case of retailers, products produced by other organisations are not included in the organisational boundary of the retailer. The retailers\u2019 boundaries are then limited to their capital goods and all processes/activities related to the retailing service. However, products produced or transformed by the retailer shall be included in the organisational boundary.

The activities and impacts linked to processes within the defined organisational boundary are considered \u2018direct\u2019 activities and impacts. For example, in the case of retailers, products produced by other organisations are not included in the organisational boundary of the retailer. The retailers\u2019 boundaries are then limited to their capital goods and all processes/activities related to the retailing service. However, products produced or transformed by the retailer shall be included in the organisational boundary. All activities and processes which occur within the organisational boundary but which are not necessary for the functioning of the organisation shall be included in the analysis. Examples of such processes/ activities are gardening activities, food served by the company in the canteen, etc. As some jointly owned/ operated facilities may contribute to the provision both of the defined PP of the organisation as well as of the productportfolio(s) of other organisations, it may be necessary to allocate inputs and outputs accordingly. 3.2.2.2 OEF boundary The OEF boundary is broader than the organisational boundary and includes all indirect activities and associated impacts. Indirect activities are those that occur upstream or downstream along the supply chains linked to organisational activities (see Section4.2.1). The OEF boundary shall be defined following a general supply chain logic. The OEF boundary shall by default include all stages from raw material acquisition through manufacturing, distribution, storage, use and end of life treatment of the PP (i.e. cradle-to-grave). All processes within the defined OEF boundary shall be considered (except for the ones fulfilling the cut-off criteria). Explicit justification shall be provided if downstream (indirect) activities are excluded (e.g. use stage and end of life stage of intermediate products or products with an undeterminable fate): in this case the OEF boundary shall include, at a minimum, site-level (direct) and upstream (indirect) activities associated with the organisation\u2019s PP. In some cases the same process may belong either to theorganisational boundary or to the OEF boundary: for example, employee transport occurs i) within the organisational boundary when employees commute using cars owned or operated by the employer, or use public transport paid for by the employer; or ii) it is regarded as an indirect process, when employees commute by private cars or public transport paid for by the employee. 3.2.2.3 System boundary diagram A system boundary diagram (or flow diagram) is a schematic representation of the analysed system. It shall clearly indicate the activities or processes that are included and those that are excluded from the analysis.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/425 The organisational boundary and the OEF boundary shall be indicated. Furthermore, the user of the OEF method shall highlight where company-specific data were used. The activity and/or process names in the system diagram and in the OEF report shall bealigned. The system diagram shall be included in the scope definition and included in the OEF report. 3.2.3. Environmental Footprint impact categories The purpose of LCIAis to group and aggregate the collected LCI data according to the respective contributions to each EF impact category. The selection of EF impact categories coversa broad range of relevant environmental issues related to the product supply chain of interest, following the general completeness requirements for OEF studies. EF impact categories15refer to specific categories of impacts considered in anOEFstudy and they constitute the EF impact assessment method. Characterisation models are used to quantify the environmental mechanism between the LCI (i.e. inputs (e.g. resources) and emissions associated with the product life-cycle) and the category indicator of each EF impact category. Table 2provides a default list of EF impact categories and related assessment methods. For anOEFstudy, all EF impact categories shall be applied, without exclusion. The full list of CFs that shall beused is provided within the EF reference package16 Table 2EF impact categories with respective impact category indicators and characterization models.

Additional environmental information Additional environmental information shall be: (a) In compliance with relevant legislation, for instance the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD)21and related guidance; (b) Based on information that is substantiated and has been reviewed or verified,according to EN ISO 14020:2001and Clause 5 of EN ISO 14021:2016; (c) Relevant to the specific sector; (d) Additional to the EF impact categories: additional environmental information shall not reflect the same or similar EF impact categories, shall not substitute the characterisation models of the EF impact categories and shall not report results of new |characterisation factors (CFs) added to EF impact categories. The supporting models forthis additional information shall be clearly referenced and documented together with the corresponding indicators. For example, biodiversity impacts due to land use changes may occur in association with a specific site or activity. This may require the application of additional impact categories that are not included among the EF impact categories, or even additional qualitative descriptions where impacts may not be linked to the product supply chain in a quantitative manner. Such additional methods should be viewed as complementary to the EF impact categories Additional environmental information shall only be related to environmental aspects. Information and instructions, e.g. product safety sheets that are not related to the environmental performance of the product,shall not be part of additional environmental information. Additional environmental information may include: (a) Information on local/site-specific impacts; (b) Offsets; (c) Environmental indicators or product responsibility indicators (e.g. as per the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)); (d) For gate-to-gate assessments, number of IUCN(International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk; (e) Description of significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity in protected areas and in areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas; (f) Noise impacts; (g) Other environmental information considered relevant within the scope of the OEFstudy. Biodiversity The OEFmethod does notinclude any impact category named \u2018biodiversity\u2018, as currently there is no international consensus on anLCIAmethod capturing that impact. However, the OEFmethod includes at least eight impact categories that have an effect on biodiversity (i.e., climate change, eutrophication (aquatic freshwater), eutrophication (aquatic marine), eutrophication (terrestrial), acidification, water use, land use, ecotoxicity freshwater). Considering the high relevance of biodiversity for many sectors, each OEFstudy shall explain whether biodiversity is relevant for the organisationin scope. If that is the case, the user of the OEFmethod shall include biodiversity indicatorsunder additional environmental information. The following options may be usedto cover biodiversity: (a) Expressingthe (avoided) impact on biodiversity as the percentage of material that comes from ecosystems that have been managed to maintain or enhance conditions for biodiversity, as demonstrated by regular monitoring and reporting of biodiversity levels and gains or losses (e.g. less than 15% loss of species richness due to disturbance-through the OEFstudies may set their own loss levelif they can make a convincing case for it and not in contradiction to a relevant existing OEFSR). 21 The UCPD and related guidance is available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Al32011\n\nL 471/428 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 The assessment should refer to materials that end up in the PPand to materials that have been used during the production process.

(c) To use a certification system as a proxy. The user of the OEFmethod should determine which certification schemes provide sufficient evidence for ensuring biodiversity maintenance and describe the criteria used. The user of the OEF method may choose other, relevant indicators to cover the impacts of the product on biodiversity. The OEFstudy shall motivate the choice and describe the chosen methodology. 3.2.4.2. Additional technical information Additional technical information may include (non-exhaustive list): (h) Information on the use of hazardous substances; (i) Information on the disposal of hazardous/non-hazardous waste; (j) Information on energy consumption; (k) Technical parameters, such as the use of renewable versus non-renewable energy, renewable versus non-renewable fuels, secondary materials, fresh water resources; (l) Total weight of waste by type and disposal method; (m) Weight of transported, imported, exported, or treated waste deemed hazardous under the terms of the Basel Convention22 Annexes I, II, III, and VIII, and percentage of transported waste shipped internationally; 3.2.5. Assumptions/ limitations In OEFstudies, several limitations oncarrying out the analysis may arise and therefore assumptions need to be made. All limitations (e.g. data gaps) and assumptions shall be transparently reported. 22OJ L 39, 16.2.1993, p. 3\u201322\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/429 4. Life cycle inventory An inventory of all material, energy and waste inputs and outputs and emissions into air, water and soilfor the product supply chain shall be compiled as a basis for modelling the OEF. Detailed data requirements and quality requirementsare described in Section4.6. The life-cycleinventory (LCI) shall adopt the following classificationof flows included: 1) elementary flows; 2) non-elementary (or complex) flows. Within the OEF study, all non-elementary flows in the LCI shall be modelled up tothe level of elementary flows, apart from the product flow for the product in scope. For example, waste flows shall not only be included in the study as kg of household waste or hazardous waste, but shall be modelled up to the stage of emissions into water, air and soil fromthe treatment of the solid waste. The LCI modelling is therefore only completed when all non- elementary flows are expressed as elementary flows. Therefore, the LCI dataset of the OEF study shall contain only elementary flows, apart from the product flow forthe product(s) in scope. 4.1. Screening step An initial screening of the LCI, the \u2018screening step\u2019, may be performed because it helps focus data collection activities and data quality priorities. A screening step shall include the LCIA phase and result infurther iterative refinements to the life-cycle model for the product in scope, as more information becomes available. Within a screening step no cut-off is allowed and readily available primary or secondary data may be used, fulfilling the data quality requirements to the extent possible (as defined in Section4.6). Once the screening is performed, the initial scope settings may be refined. 4.2 Direct activities, indirect activities and life-cycle stages Users of the OEF method shall identify direct and indirect activities (see Section4.2.1) and report separately their impact. If the product portfolio of the organisation is made of products, the user of the OEF method shall also identify the life-cyclestages of the products belonging to the PP and describe them in the OEF report (Section4.2.2). If the product portfolio includes services, the user of the OEF method may identify the life-cycle stages, if applicable. 4.2.1. Direct and indirect activities Direct activities are the ones occurring within the organisational boundary and therefore are owned and/or operated by the organisation (i.e. site-level activities).

Examples of direct activities are: \u2022 Generation of energy resulting from combustion of fuels in stationary sources (e.g. boilers, furnaces, turbines); \u2022 Physical or chemical processing (e.g. from manufacturing, processing, cleaning, etc.); \u2022 Transportation of materials, products and waste (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in company-owned and/or operated vehicles, described interms of mode of transport, vehicle type and distance; \u2022 Employees commuting (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) using vehicles owned and/or operated by the organisation, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type and distance; \u2022 Business travel (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in vehicles owned and/or operated by the organisation, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type, and distance; \u2022 Client and visitor transportation (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in vehicles owned and/or operated by the organisation, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type and distance;\n\nL 471/430 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 \u2022 Transportation from suppliers (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in vehicles owned and/or operated by the organisation, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type, distance and load; \u2022 Disposal and treatment of waste (composition, volume) when processed in facilities owned and/or operated by the organisation; \u2022 Emissions from intentional or unintentional releases(e.g. hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions during the use of air-conditioning equipment); \u2022 Other site-specific activities.

Life-cycle stages When the PP is covering products, life-cyclestages shall be identified and described in the OEF report. If the PP is covering services, life-cyclestages shall be identified and reported on, if applicable. As a minimum, the default life-cyclestages in an OEF study shall be: 1) raw material acquisition and pre-processing (including production of parts and components); 2) manufacturing (production of the main product); 3) distribution (product distribution and storage); 4) use stage; 5) end of life (including product recovery or recycling). If a different name is used for any of the default life-cyclestages, the user shall specify which default life-cycle stage it corresponds to. If there is a valid need to do so, the user of the OEF method may decide to split or add life-cycle stages. The reasons(s) for doing this shall be set out in the OEF report. For example, the life-cycle stage 'Raw material acquisition and pre-processing' may be split into 'Raw material acquisition', 'pre-processing', and 'raw materials supplier transport'.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/431 For OEF studies where the PP is made up of intermediate products, the following life-cycle stages shall be excluded: 1) distribution (", "embedding_index": 173}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_174", "text": " shall be set out in the OEF report.

Raw material acquisition and pre-processing This life-cyclestage starts when resources are extracted from nature and ends when product components enter (through the gate of) the product\u2019s production facility. Examples of processes that may occur in this stage include: 1) mining and extraction of resources; 2) pre-processing of all material inputs to the productin scope, including recyclable materials; 3) agricultural and forestry activities; 4) transportation within and between extraction and pre-processing facilities, and to the production facility. Packaging production shall be modelled as part of the \u2018Raw material acquisition and pre-processing\u2019 life-cycle stage. 4.2.4. Manufacturing The production stage begins when the product components enter the production site and ends when the finished product leaves the production facility. Examples of production-related activities include: 1) chemical processing; 2) manufacturing; 3) transport of semi-finished products between manufacturing processes; 4) assembly of material components. Waste from products used during manufacturing shall be included in the modelling forthe manufacturing stage. The circular footprint formula (Section4.4.8) shall be applied to such waste. 4.2.3. Distribution stage Products are distributed to users and may be stored at various points along the supply chain. The distribution stage includes transport from factory gate to warehouse /retail, storage at warehouse/retail, and transport from warehouse/retail to consumer home. Examples of processes to include: 1) energy inputs for warehouse lighting and heating; 2) use of refrigerants in warehouses and transport vehicles; 3) fuel use by vehicles; 4) roads and trucks. Waste from products used during distribution and storage shall be included in the modelling. The circular footprint formula (Section 4.4.8) shall be applied to such waste, and the results taken into consideration under the distribution stage. Default loss rates per type of product during distribution and at the consumer are provided in part F of Annex IV and shall be used ifno specific information is available. Allocation rules on energy consumption at storage are presented in Section4.4.5. Fortransport see Section4.4.3. 4.2.4. Use stage The use stage describes how the product is expected to be used by the end user (e.g. the consumer). Thisstage starts the moment the end user uses the product until it leaves its place of use and enters the end of life (EoL) life- cyclestage (e.g., recycling or final treatment).\n\nL 471/432 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 The use stage includes all activities and products that are needed for a proper use of the product (i.e. to ensure it performs its original function throughout its lifetime). Waste generated by using theproduct, as well as its transport to EoL facilities, such as food waste and its primary packaging or the product itself once no longer functional, is excluded from the use stage and shall be part of the EoL stage of the product. Some examples include: the provision of tap water when cooking pasta; the manufacturingand distribution of, and waste frommaterials needed for maintenance, repair or refurbishment (e.g. spare parts needed to repair the product, coolant production and waste management due to losses). The EoL of coffee capsules, residues for coffee making and packaging of ground coffee belong to the end of life stage. In some cases, some products are needed for a proper use of the product in scope and they are used in a way that they become physically integrated: in this case,the waste treatment of these products belongs to the EoL of the product in scope. For example, when the product in scope is a detergent, the treatment of the waste water, following the use of the detergent, belongs to the end of life stage. The use scenario also needs to reflect whether or not the use of the analysed products might lead to changes in the systems in which they are used.

The manufacturer\u2019s recommended method to be applied in the use stage (e.g. cooking in an oven at a specified temperature for a specified time) shouldbe used to provide a basis for determining the use stage of a product.

Default loss rates per type of product during distribution and at consumer are provided in part F of Annex IV and shall be used ifno specific information isavailable. Documentation of methods and assumptions shall be provided in the OEF report. All relevant assumptions for the use stage shall be documented. Technical specifications to model the use stage are available in Section4.4.7. 4.2.5. End of life (including product recovery and recycling) The EoL stage begins when the products in the PP in scope and their packaging are discarded by the user and ends when the products are returned to nature as a waste product or enters another product\u2019s life-cycle(i.e. as a recycled content). In general thisincludes the waste fromthe product(s) in scope, such as food waste and primary packaging. Waste generated during the manufacturing, distribution, retail, use stage or after use shall be included in the life- cycleof the product and modelled at the life-cyclestage where it occurs. The end of life stage shall be modelled using the circular footprint formula and requirements provided in Section 4.4.8. The userof the OEF method shall include all EoL processes applicable to the PP in scope. Examples of processes to be covered in this life-cyclestage include: 1) collection and transport of the product in scope and its packaging to end of life treatment facilities; 2) dismantling of components; 3) shredding and sorting; 4) wastewater fromproducts used, dissolved in or with water (e.g. detergents, shower gels, etc.); 5) conversion into recycled material; 6) composting or other organic-waste-treatment methods;\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/433 7) incineration and disposal of bottom ash; 8) landfillingand landfill operation and maintenance.

Modelling requirements This Sectionprovides detailed guidance and requirements on how to model specific life-cyclestages, processes and other aspects of the product life-cycle, in order to compile the LCI. Covered aspects include: (a) agricultural production; (b) electricity use; (c) transport and logistics; (d) capital goods (infrastructure and equipment); (e) storage at distribution center or retail; (f) sampling procedure; (g) use stage; (h) end of life modelling; (i) extended product lifetime; (j) packaging; (k) GHG emissions and removals; (l) offsets; (m) handling multi-functional processes; (n) data collection requirements and quality requirements; (o) cut-off. 4.4.1 Agricultural production 4.4.1.1.

Averaging data Cultivation data shall be collected over a period of time sufficient to provide an average assessment of the LCI associated with the inputs and outputs of cultivation that will offset fluctuations due to seasonal differences. This shall be undertaken as described in the LEAP guidelines, set out below: (a) For annual crops, an assessment period of at least three years shall be used (to level out differences in crop yields related to fluctuations in growing conditions over the years such as climate, pests and diseases, etc). Where data covering a three-year period is not available i.e. due to starting up a new production system (e.g. new greenhouse, newly cleared land, shift to other crop), the assessment may be conducted over a shorter period, but shall be not less than 1 year. Crops or plants grown in greenhouses shall be considered to be annual crops/ plants, unless the cultivation cycle is significantly shorter than a year and another crop is cultivated consecutively within that year. Tomatoes, peppers and other crops, which are cultivated and harvested over a longer period through the year are considered to be annual crops. (b) For perennial plants (including entire plants and edible portions of perennial plants) a steady state situation (i.e. where all development stages are proportionally represented in the studied time period) shall be assumed and a three-year period shall be used to estimate the inputs and outputs. (c) Where the different stages in the cultivation cycle may be of differing duration, a correction shall be made by adjusting the crop areas allocated to different development stages in proportion to the crop areas expected in a theoretical steady state. The application of such corrections shall be explained and recorded in the OEF report. The LCI of perennial plants and crops shall not be undertaken until the production system actually yields output. (d) For crops that are grown and harvested in less than one year (e.g. lettuce produced in 2 to 4 months) data shall be gathered in relation to the specific time period for production of a single crop, from at least three recent consecutive cycles. Averaging over three years may best be done by first gathering annual data and calculating the LCI per year and then determining the three years average. 4.4.1.4. Pesticides Pesticide emissions shall be modelled as specific active ingredients. The USEtox life-cycle impact assessment method has a built-in multimedia fate model which simulates the fate of the pesticides starting from the different emission compartments. Therefore, the ratio of default emission fractions to environmental emission compartmentsisneeded in the LCI modelling. The pesticides applied to the field shall be modelled as 90% emitted to the agricultural soil compartment, 9% emitted to air and 1% emitted to water (based on expert judgement due to current limitations). More specific data may be used if available. 4.4.1.5. Fertilisers Fertiliser (and manure) emissions shall be differentiated per fertiliser type and cover as a minimum: (a) NH, to air (from the use of N-fertiliser); 3 (b) NO, to air (direct and indirect) (from use of N-fertiliser); 2 (c) CO, to air (from the use of lime, urea and urea-compounds); 2 (d) NO, to water unspecified (leaching from use of N-fertiliser); 3 (e) PO, to water unspecified or freshwater (leaching and run-off of soluble phosphate from use of P- 4 fertiliser); (f) P, to water unspecified or freshwater (soil particles containing phosphorous, from use of P-fertiliser). The impact assessment model for freshwater eutrophication starts (i) when P leaves the agricultural field (run off) or (ii) from the application of manure", "embedding_index": 176}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_177", "text": "aching from use of N-fertiliser); 3 (e) PO, to water unspecified or freshwater (leaching and run-off of soluble phosphate from use of P- 4 fertiliser); (f) P, to water unspecified or freshwater (soil particles containing phosphorous, from use of P-fertiliser). The impact assessment model for freshwater eutrophication starts (i) when P leaves the agricultural field (run off) or (ii) from the application of manure or fertiliser on the agricultural field. Within LCI modelling, the agricultural field (soil) is often seen as belonging to the technosphere and thus included in the LCI model. This aligns with approach (i), where the impact assessment model starts after run-off, i.e. when P leaves the agricultural field. Therefore, within the EF context, the LCI should be modelled as the amount of P emitted to water after run-off and the emission compartment \u2018water\u2019 shall be used.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/435 When this amount is not available, the LCI may be modelled as the amount of P applied tothe agricultural field (through manure or fertilisers) and the emission compartment \u2018soil\u2019 shall be used. In this case, the run-off from soil to water is part of the impact assessment method and included in the characterization factorfor soil. The impact assessment marine eutrophication starts after N leaves the field (soil). Therefore, N emissions to soil shall not be modelled. The amount of emissions ending up in the different air and water compartments per amount of fertilisers applied tothe field shall be modelled within the LCI. N emissions shall be calculated from nitrogen applications bythe farmer tothe field and excluding external sources (e.g. rain deposition). The number of emissions factors is fixed in the EF context by following a simplified approach. For N-fertilisers, the Tier 1 emissions factors of Table 2-4 of IPCC (2006)shall be used, as reproduced in Table 3, except when better data is available. If better data is available, a more comprehensive nitrogen field model may be used in the OEF study, provided (i) it covers at least the emissions requested above, (ii) N shall be balanced in inputs and outputs and (iii) it shall be described in a transparent way.

The N-balance is calculated using the parameters in Table 4and the formula below. The total NO-N emission to 3 water is considered a variable and its total inventory shall be calculated as: \u2018Total NO-N emission to water\u2018 = \u2018NO-base loss\u2018 + \u2018additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018, with 3 3 3 \u2018Additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018 = \u2018N input with all fertilisers\u2018 + \u2018N fixation by crop\u2018 \u2013 \u2018N- 3 2 removal with the harvest\u2018 \u2013\u2018NH emissions to air\u2018 \u2013\u2018NO emissions to air\u2018 \u2013\u2018N emissions to air\u2018 -\u2018NO- 3 2 2 3 base loss\u2018.

This last step serves to avoid fertility-depletion schemes by capturing the N-depletion by the analysed crop that is assumed to lead to the need for additional fertiliser later on and to keep the same soil fertility level.

Heavy metal emissions Heavy metal emissions from field inputs shall be modelled as emission to soil and/or leaching or erosion to water. The inventory to water shall specify the oxidation state of the metal (e.g., Cr+3, Cr+6). As crops assimilate part of the heavy metal emissions during their cultivation clarification is needed on how to model crops that act as a sink. Two different modelling approaches are allowed: (a) The final fate of the heavy metal elementary flows isnot further considered within the system boundary: the inventory does not account for the final emissions of the heavy metals and therefore shall not account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. For example, heavy metals in agricultural crops grownfor human consumption end up in the plant. Within the EF context human consumption is not modelled, the final fate is not further modelled and the plant acts as a heavy metal sink. Therefore, the uptake of heavy metals by the crop shall not be modelled. (b) The final fate (emission compartment) of the heavy metal elementary flows is considered within the system boundary: the inventory does account for the final emissions (release) of the heavy metals in the environment and therefore shall also account for theuptake of heavy metals by the crop. For example, heavy metals in crops grown for feed will mainly end up in the animal digestion and used as manure back on the field where the metals are released in the environment and their impacts are captured by the impact assessment methods. Therefore, the inventory of the agricultural stage shall account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. A limited amount ends up in the animal, which may be neglected for simplification. 4.4.1.7 Rice cultivation Methane emissions from rice cultivation shall be included based on the calculation rules inSection5.5. of IPCC (2006)\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/437 4.4.1.8.

Other activities If applicable, the following activities shall be included in agricultural modelling, unless they are allowed to be excludedbased on the cut-off criteria: (a) input of seed material (kg/ha), (b) input of peat to soil (kg/ha + C/N ratio), (c) input of lime (kg CaCO/ha, type), 3 (d) machine use (hours, type) (to be included if there is high level of mechanisation), (e) input N from crop residues that stay on the field or are burned (kg residue + N content/ha). Including emissions from residues burning, drying and storage of products. Unless it is clearly documented that operations are carried out manually, field operationsshall be accounted for through total fuel consumption or through inputs of specific machinery, transports to/ from thefield, energy for irrigation, or similar. 4.4.2. Electricity use Electricity used from the grid must be modelled as precisely as possible giving preference to supplier-specific data. If (part of) the electricity is renewable,it is important that no double counting occurs. Therefore, the supplier shall guarantee that the electricity supplied to the organisation to produce the product is effectively generated using renewable sources and is not available anymore for other consumers. 4.4.2.1. General guidelines The following Sectionintroduces two types of electricity mixes: (i) the consumption grid mix which reflects the total electricity mix transferred over a defined grid including green claimed or tracked electricity, and (ii) the residual grid mix, consumption mix (also named residual consumption mix), which characterizes the unclaimed, untracked or publicly shared electricity only. In OEF studies the following electricity mix shall be used, in hierarchical order: (a) Supplier-specific electricity product25shall be used if, for a country,there is a 100% tracking system in place, or if : (i) available, and (ii) the set of minimum criteria to ensure the contractual instruments are reliable is met. (b) The supplier-specific total electricity mix shall be used if: (i) available, and (ii) the set of minimum criteria to ensure the contractual instruments are reliable is met. (c) The \u2018country-specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019 shall be used. Country-specific means the country in which the life-cyclestage or activity occurs. This may be an EU country or non-EU country. The residual grid mix prevents double counting with the use of supplier-specific electricity mixes in (a) and (b). (d) As a last option, the average EU residual grid mix, consumption mix (EU+EFTA), or region representative residual grid mix, consumption mix, shall be used. The environmental integrity of the use of supplier-specific electricity mix depends on ensuring that contractual instruments (for tracking) are reliable and unique. Without this, the OEF lacks the accuracy and consistency needed to drive product/corporate electricity procurement decisions and accurate consideration of the supplier- specific mix by buyers of electricity. Therefore, a set of minimum criteria that relate to the integrity of the 25 See EN ISO 14067:2018\n\nL 471/438 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 contractual instruments as reliable conveyers of environmental footprint information has been identified. They represent the minimum features necessary to use asupplier-specific mix within OEF studies. 4.4.2.2. Set of minimum criteria to ensure contractual instruments from suppliers A supplier-specific electricity product/ mix may only be used if the user of the OEF method ensures that the contractual instrument meets the criteria specified below.

Criteria 3 Be issued and redeemed as close as possible to the period of electricity consumption to which the contractual instrument is applied. 4.4.2.3. How to model \u2018country-specific residual grid mix,consumption mix\u2019 The user of the OEF method should identify suitable datasets for residual grid mix, consumption mix, per energy type, per country and per voltage If no suitable dataset is available, the following approach should be used: determine the country consumption mix (e.g. X% of MWh produced with hydro energy, Y% of MWh produced with coal power plant) and combine them with LCI datasets per energy type and country/region (e.g. LCI dataset for the production of 1MWh hydro energy in Switzerland). 1) Activity data related to non-EU country consumption mix per detailed energy type shall be determined based on: (a) domestic production mix per production technology; (b) import quantity and from which neighbouring countries; 27European Residual Mix | AIB (aib-net.org)\n\nL 471/440 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 (c) transmission losses; (d) distribution losses; (e) type of fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and / or domestic supply). These data should be found in the publications of the International Energy Agency (IEA) publications. 2) Available LCI datasets per fuel technology. The LCI datasets available are generally specific to a country or a region in terms of: (a) fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and/ or domestic supply); (b) energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy contents); (c) technology standards of power plants regarding efficiency, firing technology, flue-gas desulphurisation, NO removal and de-dusting. x 4.4.2.4. A single location with multiple products and more than one electricity mix This Sectiondescribes how to proceed if only someof the electricity usedis covered by a supplier-specific mix or on-site electricity generation and howtoallocatethe electricity mix among products produced at the same location. In general, the subdivision of electricity supply used among multiple products is based on a physical relationship (e.g. number of pieces or kg of product). If the consumed electricity comes from more than one electricity mix, each mix source shall be used in terms of its proportion in the total kWh consumed. For example, if afraction of this total kWh consumed comesfrom a specific supplier, a supplier-specific electricity mix shall be used for this amount. See Section 4.4.2.7 for on-site electricity use. A specific type of electricity may be allocated to one specific productwith the following conditions: (a) If the production (andtherelated electricity consumption) of a product occurs in a separate site (building), the energy type that is physically related to this separated site may be used. (b) If the production (and the related electricity consumption) of a product occurs in a space shared with specific energy metering or purchase records or electricity bills, the product-specific information (measure, record, bill) may be used. (c) If all the products produced in the specific plantare supplied with a publically available OEF study, the company that wantsto make the claim related to energy used shall make all OEF studies available. The allocation rule applied shall be described in the OEF study, consistently applied in all OEF studies connected to the site and verified. An example is the 100% allocation of a greener electricity mix to a specific product. 4.4.2.5. For multiple locations producing one product In case a product is produced in different locations or sold in different countries, the electricity mix shall reflect the ratios of production or ratios of sales between EU countries/regions. To determine the ratio, a physical unit shall be used (e.g. number of pieces or kg of product). For OEF studies where such data are not available, the average EU residual consumption mix (EU+EFTA),", "embedding_index": 181}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_182", "text": " mix to a specific product. 4.4.2.5. For multiple locations producing one product In case a product is produced in different locations or sold in different countries, the electricity mix shall reflect the ratios of production or ratios of sales between EU countries/regions. To determine the ratio, a physical unit shall be used (e.g. number of pieces or kg of product). For OEF studies where such data are not available, the average EU residual consumption mix (EU+EFTA), or region-representative residual mix, shall be used. The same general guidelines mentioned above shall be applied. 4.4.2.6. Electricity use at the use stage Duringthe use stage,the consumption grid mix shall be used. The electricity mix shall reflect the ratios of sales between EU countries/ regions. To determine the ratio, a physical unit shall be used (e.g. number of pieces or kg of product). Where such data are not available, the average EU consumption mix (EU+EFTA), or region- representative consumption mix, shall be used. 4.4.2.7 On-site electricity generation If on-site electricity production equalsthe site\u2019s consumption, two situations apply: (a) no contractual instruments have been sold to a third party: the user of the OEF method shall model its own electricity mix (combined with LCI datasets). (b) contractual instruments have been sold to a third party: the user of the OEF method shall use \u2018country- specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019 (combined with LCI datasets).\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/441 If the amount of electricity produced exceeds the amount consumed on-site within the defined system boundary and is sold to, e.g. the electricity grid, this system may be seen as a multi-functional situation. The system will provide two functions (e.g. product + electricity) and the following rules shall be followed: (a) If possible, apply subdivision. This applies both to separate electricity productions or to a common electricity production where you may allocate based on electricity amounts the upstream and direct emissions to your own consumption and to the share you sell to a third party (e.g. if a company uses a windmill on its production site and exports 30% of the produced electricity, emissions related to 70% of produced electricity should be accounted in the OEF study). (b) If not possible, direct substitution shall be used. The country-specific residual consumption electricity mix shall be used as substitution28. Subdivision is not considered possible when upstream impacts or direct emissions are closely related to the product itself. 4.4.3. Transport and logistics The following parameters shall be taken into account when modelling transport activities: (6) Transport type:the type of transport, e.g. by land (truck,rail, pipe), by water (boat, ferry, barge), or air (airplane); (7) Vehicle type:the type of vehicle by transport type; (8) Loading rate (=utilisation ratio; see next Section)29:environmental impacts are directly linked to the actual loading rate, which shall therefore be considered. The loading rate affects thevehicle\u2019s fuel consumption; (9) Number of empty returns:the number of empty returns (i.e. the ratio of the distance travelled to collect the next load after unloading the product to the distance travelled to transport the product), when applicable and relevant, shall be taken into account. The kilometres travelled by the empty vehicle shall be allocated to the product. In default transport datasets this is often already taken into account in the default utilisation ratio. (10) Transport distance: transport distances shall be documented, applying average transport distances specific to the context being considered; Within the EF compliant datasets, the fuel production and fuel consumption by the transport vehicle,the necessary infrastructure needed and the amount of additional resources and tools needed for logistic operations (e.g.cranes and transporters) are included in the transport datasets. 4.4.3.1. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013 truck transport EF compliant datasets for truck transport are per tkm (tonne*km) expressing the environmental impact for 1 tonne (t) of product that is transported for 1km in a truck with acertain load. The transport payload (=maximum mass allowed) is indicated in the dataset. For example, a truck of 28-32 t has a payload of 22 t; the LCA dataset for 1 tkm (fully loaded) expresses the environmental impact for 1 t of product that is transported for 1km within a 22 t loaded truck. The transport emissions are allocated based onthe transported product\u2019s mass andyou get only a share of 1/22of the truck\u2019sfull emissions. When the load transported is lower than the maximum load capacity (e.g.,", "embedding_index": 182}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_183", "text": ", a truck of 28-32 t has a payload of 22 t; the LCA dataset for 1 tkm (fully loaded) expresses the environmental impact for 1 t of product that is transported for 1km within a 22 t loaded truck. The transport emissions are allocated based onthe transported product\u2019s mass andyou get only a share of 1/22of the truck\u2019sfull emissions. When the load transported is lower than the maximum load capacity (e.g., 10 t), the environmental impact for 1 t of product is affected in two ways. First, the truck has less fuel consumption per total load transported and second, its environmental impact is allocated by the load transported (e.g., 1/10 t). When a full freight\u2019s mass is lower than the truck\u2019s load capacity (e.g. 10 t), the transport of the product may be considered volume limited. In this case, the environmental impact shall be calculated using the real mass loaded. In EF compliant datasets the transport payload should be modelled in a parameterised way through the utilisation ratio. The utilisation ratio affects (i) the truck\u2019s total fuel consumption and (ii) the allocationto impact per ton. The utilisation ratio is calculated as the kg real load divided by the kg payload and shall be adjusted when the datasetis used. In case the real load is 0 kg, a real load of 1 kg shall be used for the calculation. Empty return trips may be included in the utilisation ratio by taking into accountthe percentage of empty km driven. e.g., if the truck is fully loaded for delivery but half-empty upon at its return, the utilisation ratio is (22 t real load / 22 t payload * 50% km + 11 t real load / 22 t payload * 50% km) = 75%. 28 For some countries, this option is a best case rather than a worst case. 29 The loading rate is the ratio of actual load to the full load/ capacity (e.g. mass or volume) that a vehicle carries per trip.\n\nL 471/442 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 OEF studies shall specify the utilisation ratio to be used for each type of truck transport modelled and clearly indicate whether the utilisation ratio includes empty return trips. The following default utilisation ratios apply: (a) If the load is mass-limited: a default utilisation ratio of 64%30 shall be used, unless specific data is available. This default utilisation ratio includes empty return trips and thus shall not be modelled separately. (b) Bulk transport (e.g., gravel transport from mining pit to concrete plant) shall be modelled with a default utilisation ratio of 50% (100% loaded outbound and 0% loaded inbound), unless specific data is available. 4.4.3.2. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013 van transport Vans are often used for home delivery, e.g. delivery of books and clothes or home delivery from retailers. For vans, the limiting factoris volumerather than mass. If no specific information is available to perform the OEF study, a lorry of <1.2 t with a defaultutilisation ratio of 50% shall be used. In case no dataset of a lorry of <1.2 t is available, a lorry of <7.5 t shall be used as an approximation, with anutilisation ratio of 20%. A lorry of <7.5 t with a payload of 3.3 t and a utilisation ratio of 20% has to the same load as a van with apayload of 1.2 t and utilisation ratio of 50%. 4.4.3.3. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013 consumer transport Allocation of the car impact shall be based on volume. The maximum volume to be considered for consumer transport is 0.2 m3(around 1/3 of a trunk of 0.6 m3). For products larger than 0.2 m3the full car transport impact shall be considered. For products sold through supermarkets or shopping malls, the product volume (including packaging and empty spaces such as between fruits or bottles) shall be used to allocate the transport burdens between the products transported. The allocation factor shall be calculated as the volume of the product transported divided by 0.2 m3. To simplify the modelling, all other typesof consumer transport (like buying in specialised shops or using combined trips) shall be modelled as if sold through a supermarket. 4.4.3.4.

If capital goods are included, the OEF report shall include a clear and extensive explanation, on why they are relevant, reporting all assumptionsmade. 4.4.5. Storage at the distribution centre or retail Storage activities consume energy and refrigerant gases. The following default data shall be used, unless better data is available: \u2022 Energy consumption at the distribution centre: the storage energyconsumption is 30 kWh/m2/year and 360 MJ bought (= burnt in boiler) or 10 Nm3natural gas/m2\u00b7year (if you use the value per Nm3, do not forget to consider emissions from combustion,not only production of natural gas). For centres that contain cooling systems, the additional energy use for the chilled or frozen storage is 40 kWh/m3\u00b7year (with an assumption of 2 m high for the fridges and freezers). For centres with both ambient and cooled storage: 20% of the DC\u2019s areais chilled or frozen. Note: the energyused for chilled or frozen storage is only the energyusedto maintain the temperature. \u2022 Energy consumption at retail: General energy consumption of 300 kWh/m2/year for the entire building surface shall be considered as the default. For retail specialised in non-food/ non-beverage products,150 kWh/m2\u00b7year for the entire building surface shall be considered. For retail specialised in food/ beverage products,400 kWh/m2\u00b7year for the entire building surface plus energy consumption for chilled and frozen storage of 1900 kWh/m2\u00b7year and 2700 kWh/m2\u00b7year respectively is to be considered (PERIFEM and ADEME, 2014). \u2022 Refrigerant gases consumption and leakages at DCs with cooling systems: gas content in fridges and freezers is 0.29 kg R404A per m2(retail OEFSR34). Annual leakage of 10% is considered (Palandre 2003).

This allocation shall be based on the space (in m3) and time (in weeks) occupied by the product stored. For this, the total storage capacity of the system shall be known, and the product-specific volume and storage time shall be used to calculate the allocation factor (as the ratio between product-specific volume*time and storage capacity volume*time). An average DC is assumed to store 60000 m3of product, out of which 48000 m3for ambient storage and 12000 m3 for chilled or frozen storage. For 52 weeks of storage, a default total storage capacity of 3 120 000 m3*weeks/year shall be assumed. An average retail place is assumed to store 2000 m3of products (assumingthat 50% of the 2000 m2buildingarea is covered by shelves that are 2 m high) over52 weeks, i.e. 104000 m3* weeks/year. 4.4.6. Sampling procedure In some cases, the user of the OEF method needs a sampling procedure to limit the data collection to only to a representative sample of plants, farms etc. The user of the OEF method shall (i) specify in the OEF report if sampling was applied, (ii) follow the requirements described in this Sectionand (iii) indicate which approach was used. Examples of cases when the sampling procedure may be needed are those where multiple production sites are involved in producingof the same product. E.g., ifthe same raw material/input material comes from multiple sites or ifthe same process is outsourced to more than one subcontractor/ supplier. The representative sample shall be derived via a stratified sample, i.e. one that ensures that sub-populations (strata) of a given population are each adequately represented within the whole sample of a research study. Using a stratified sample allows for moreprecision than a simple random sample, provided that the sub-populations have been chosen so that the items of the same sub-population are as similar as possible in terms of the characteristics of interest. In addition, a stratified sample guarantees better coverage of the population35. The following procedureshall be applied in order to select a representative sample as a stratified sample: i. define the population; ii. define homogeneous sub-populations (stratification); iii. define the sub-samples at sub-population level; iv. define the sample for the population starting from the definition of sub-samples at sub- population level. 4.4.6.1. How to define homogeneous sub-populations (stratification) Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups (sub-populations) before sampling. The sub-populations should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population shall be assigned to only one sub-population. The following aspectsneedto be taken into consideration in identifyingthe sub-populations: (a) geographical distribution of sites; (b) technology/ farming practices involved; (c) production capacity of the companies/sites taken into consideration. Additional aspects to be taken into consideration may be added. The number of sub-populations shall be calculated as follows: [Equation 1] \u2022 Nsp: number of sub-populations; \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41=\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u2217\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 \u2022 g : number of countries in which the sites/plants/farms are located; 35 The researcher has control over the sub-populations that are included in the sample, whereas simple random sampling does not guarantee that sub-populations (strata) of a given population are each adequately represented within the final sample.

Example 1 Identify the number of sub-populations for the following population: Out of 350 farmers located in the same region in Spain, all the farmers have more or less the same annual production and use the sameharvestings techniques. In this case: g=1 : all the farmers are located in the same country t=1 : all the farmers usethe same harvesting techniques c=1 : the capacity of the companies is almost the same (i.e. theyhave the same annual production) Only one sub-population may be identified that coincides with the population. \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41=\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u2217\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50=1\u22171\u22171=1 Example 2 350 farmers are distributed acrossthree different countries (100 in Spain, 200 in France and 50 in Germany). There are two different harvesting techniques used, and these differ in a relevant way (Spain: 70 technique A, 30 technique B; France: 100 technique A, 100 technique B; Germany: 50 technique A). The capacity of the farmers in term of annual production varies between 10 000 t and 100 000 t. According to expert judgement/ relevant literature, it has been estimated that farmers with an annual production lower than 50000 t are completely different in terms of efficiency compared to the farmers with an annual production higher than 50000 t. Two classes of companies are defined based on annual production: class 1, if production is lower than 50 000 and class 2, if production ishigher than 50000. (Spain: 80 class 1, 20 class 2; France: 50 class 1, 150 class 2; Germany: 50 class 1). Table 6includes the details about the population.

How to define sub-sample size at sub-population level Once the sub-populations have been identified, the sample size of each shall be calculated (the sub-sample size). Two alternative approaches are possible: i. Based on the total production of the sub-population: The user of the OEF method shall identify the percentage of production that each sub-populationwill cover.It shall not be lower than 50%, expressed in the relevant unit. This percentage determines the sample size within the sub-population. ii.

How to define the sample for the population The representative sample of the population corresponds to the sum of the sub-samples at sub-population level. 4.4.6.4. What to do in case rounding is necessary Ifrounding is necessary, the general rule used in mathematics shall be applied: (a) If the number you are rounding is followed by 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, round the number up. (b) If the number you are rounding is followed by 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, round the number down. 4.4.7. Modelling requirements for the use stage The use stage often involves multiple processes. A distinction shall be made between (i) product independent and (ii) product dependent processes. (i) Product independent processeshave no relationship with the way the product is designed or distributed. The use stage process impacts will remain the same for all products in this product (sub-)category even if the producer changes the product's characteristics. Therefore, they do not contribute to any form of differentiation between two products or might even hide the difference. Examples are the use of a glass for drinking wine (considering thatthe product does not determine a difference in glass use); frying time when using olive oil; energy use for boiling one litre of water used for preparing coffee made from bulk instant coffee; and the washing machine used for heavy laundry detergents (capital good).

(ii) Product dependent processesare directly or indirectly determined or influenced by the product design or are related to instructions forusingthe product. These processes depend on the product characteristics and therefore help differentiate between two products. All instructions provided by the producer and directed towards the consumer (through labels, websites or other media) shall be considered as product dependent. Examples of\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/449 instructions are indications on how long the food must be cooked, how much water must be used, or in the case of drinks the recommended serving temperature and storage conditions. An example of a direct dependent process is the energy use used by electrical equipment under normal conditions. Product dependent processes shall be included in the system boundary of the OEF study. Product independent processes shall be excluded from the system boundary and qualitative information may be provided. For final products the LCIA results shall be reported for (i) the total life-cycleand (ii) the total life-cycleexcluding the use stage. 4.4.7.1. Main function approach or delta approach Modelling of the use stage may be done in different ways. Very often the related impacts and activities are modelled fully, e.g. the total electricity consumption when using a coffee machine, or the total cooking time and related gas consumption when boiling pasta.In these cases, the use stage processes for drinking coffee or eating pasta are related to theproduct\u2019smain function (referred to as \u2018main function approach\u2019). In some cases, the use of one product may influence the environmental impact of another, as decribed in the following examples: (a) A toner cartridge is not \u2018responsible\u2018 for the paper it prints on. But if a remanufactured toner cartridge works less efficiently and causes more paper loss compared to an original cartridge, the additional paper loss should be considered. In that case, the paper loss is a product-dependent process of the use stage of a remanufactured cartridge. (b) The energy consumption during the use stage of the battery/ charger system is not related to the amount of energy stored and released from the battery. It only refers to the energy loss in each loading cycle, whichmay be caused by the loading system or the internal losses in the battery. In these cases, only the additional activities and processes should be allocated to the product(e.g. paper and energy for the remanufactured toner cartridge and battery respectively). The allocation method involves taking all associated products in the system (in this case,paperand energy), and allocating the excess consumption of these associated products to the product which is considered responsible for this excess. This requires a reference amount of consumption to be defined for each associated product (e.g. of energy and materials), which refers to the minimum consumption that is essential for providing the function. The consumption above this reference (the delta) will then be allocated to the product (referred to as \u2018Delta approach\u2018)36. This approach shall only be used to increase impacts and to account for additional consumption above the reference. To define the reference situation, the following shall be considered, if available: (a) regulations applicable to the product in scope; (b) standards or harmonised standards; (c) recommendations from manufacturers or manufacturers' organisations; (d) use agreements established by consensus in sector-specific working groups. The user of the OEF method is free to decide which approach is taken and shall describe the one applied in the OEF report (main function approach or delta approach). 4.4.7.2. Modelling the use stage Part D of Annex IV provides default data to be used to model use stage activities. If available, better data should be used, and shall be made transparent and justified in the OEF report. 4.4.8.

Default values for some parameters (A, R, R, R 1 2 3 and Q/Q for packaging) are available in Part C of Annex IV37(see following Sections for further details): users s p of the OEF method shall refer to the version of Part C of Annex IV they are using38. 4.4.8.2. The A factor The A factor allocates burdens and credits from recycling and virgin material production between two life-cycles (i.e. the one supplying and the one using recycled material) and it aims to reflect market realities. An A factor equal to1 would reflect a 100:0 approach (i.e. credits are given only to the recycled content), while an A factor equal to 0 would reflect a 0:100 approach (i.e. credits are given only to the recyclable materials at the EoL). In OEF studies the A factor values shall be in the range 0.2 \u2264 A \u2264 0.8, to always capture both aspects of recycling (recycled content and recyclability at end of life). The driver determiningthe values of the A factor is the analysis of the market situation. This means: 1) A=0.2\u2013low offer of recyclable materials and high demand: the formula focuses on recyclability at EoL. 2) A=0.8\u2013high offer of recyclable materials and low demand: the formula focuses on recycled content. 3) A=0.5\u2013equilibrium between offer and demand: the formula focuses both on recyclability atEoLand recycled content. Default application-specific and material-specific A values are available in Part C of Annex IV. The following procedure shall be applied (in hierarchical order) to select the value of A to be used in an OEF study: 1) check in Part C of Annex IV the availability of an application-specific A value which fits the OEF study, 2) if an application-specific A value is not available, the material-specific A value in Part C of Annex IV shall be used, 3) if a material-specific A value is not available, the user shall apply an A value of 0.5. 4.4.8.3. The B factor The B factor is used as an allocation factor of energy recovery processes. It applies both to burdens and credits. Credits refer to the amount of heat and electricity sold, not to the total energy produced, taking into account relevant variations over a 12-monthperiod, e.g. for heat. In OEF studies the B value shall, by default, be equal to 0, unless another appropriate value is available in part C of Annex IV. To avoid double-counting between the current and the subsequent system in case of energy recovery, the subsequent system shall model its own energy use from energy recovery processes as primary energy (if the B value has been set at a value other than 0in the upstream system, the user of the OEF method shall ensure that no double counting occurs). 4.4.8.4. The point of substitution It is necessary to determine the point of substitution to apply the \u2018material\u2018 part of the formula. The point of substitution is to the point in the value chain where secondary materials substitute for primary materials. The point of substitution should be identified in correspondence to the process where input flows comefrom 100% primary sources and 100% secondary sources (level 1 in Figure 4). In some cases, the point of substitution may be identified after some mixing of primary and secondary material flows has occurred (level 2 in Figure 4). \u2022 Point of substitution at level 1: this corresponds to e.g. the point where metal scrap, glass cullet and pulp input to the process. \u2022 Point of substitution at level 2: this corresponds to e.g. the point where e.g. metal ingots, glass and paperinput to the process. The point of substitution at this level may be applied only if the datasets used to model e.g. E and E take into rec v account the real (average) flows regarding primary and secondary material. For example, if E", "embedding_index": 192}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_193", "text": " this corresponds to e.g. the point where metal scrap, glass cullet and pulp input to the process. \u2022 Point of substitution at level 2: this corresponds to e.g. the point where e.g. metal ingots, glass and paperinput to the process.

Figure 4Point of substitution at level 1 and level 2 Figure 4is a schematic representation of a generic situation (flows are 100% primary and 100% secondary). In practice in some situations, more than one point of substitution may be identified at different steps in the value chain, as represented in Figure 5, where e.g. scrap of two different qualities is processed at different steps. Figure 5Example of point of substitutions at different steps in the value chain. 4.4.8.5. The quality ratios: Qsin/Qp and Qsout/Qp Two quality ratios are used in the CFF, to take into account the quality of both the ingoing and the outgoing recycled materials: Qsin/Qp and Qsout/Qp. Two different cases are distinguished:\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/453 (a) If Ev=E*v, the two quality ratios are needed: Qs in /Q p associated to the recycled content, and Qs out /Q p associated to recyclability at EoL. The quality factors are there to capture the downcycling of a material compared to the original primary material and, in some cases, may capture the effect of multiple recycling loops. (b) If Ev\u2260E*v,one quality ratio is needed: Qs /Q associated to the recycled content. In this case E*v refers in p to the Reporting unit of the material substituted in a specific application. For example, plastic recycled to produce a bench modelled via substitution of cement shall also take intoaccount the \u2018how much\u2018, \u2018how long\u2018 and \u2018how well\u2018. Therefore, the E*v parameter indirectly integrates the Qs /Q parameter, and out p therefore the Qs and Qp parameters are not part of the CFF. out The quality ratios shall be determined at the point of substitution and per application or material. The quantification of the quality ratios shall be based onthe following: (a) Economic aspects: i.e. price ratio of secondary compared to primary materials at the point of substitution. Ifthe price of secondary materialsis higher than that of primary ones, the quality ratios shall be set equal to 1. (b) When economic aspects are less relevant than physical aspects, the latter may be used. Packaging materials used by industry are often the same within different sectors and product groups: Part C of Annex IV provides one worksheet with Qs /Q and Qs /Q values applicable to packaging materials. The in p out p company conducting an OEF study may use different values, which shall be made transparent and justified in the OEF report. 4.4.8.6. Recycled content (R1) The R values applied shall be company-specific or default secondary (application-specific), depending on the 1 information accessible to the company conducting the OEF study. Default secondary (application-specific) R 1 values are available in Part C of Annex IV.The following procedure shall be applied (in hierarchical order) to select the value of R to be used in an OEF study: 1 (a) Supply-chain specific values shall be used when the process is run by the company conducting the OEF study or when the process is not run by the company conducting the OEF study but the company has access to (company-)specific information.

The applied R values shall be subject to OEF study verification. 1 4.4.8.7. Guidelines when using company-specific R1 values When using company specific R values other than 0, traceability throughout the supply chain is mandatory. The 1 following general guidelines shall be followed: 1) the supplier information (through e.g., statement of conformity or delivery note) shall be maintained during all the production and delivery stages at the converter; 2) once the material is delivered to the converter for producing the end products, the converter shall handle information through their regular administrative procedures; 3) the converter for producing the end products claiming recycled content shall demonstrate through its management system the percentage [%] of recycled input material into the respective end product(s). 4) the latter demonstration shall be transferred upon request to the person using the end product. Ifan OEF profile is calculated and reported, this shall be stated as additional technical information of the OEF profile. 5) Industry- or company-owned traceability systems may be applied as long as they cover the general guidelines outlined above. If not, they shall be supplemented with the general guidelines above. For the packaging industry, the following industry-specific guidelines are recommended:\n\nL 471/454 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 1) for the container glass industry: the European Commission Regulation No 1179/2012. This Regulation requests a statement of conformity delivered by the cullet producer. 2) for the paper industry: the European Recovered Paper Identification System (CEPI \u2013Confederation of European Paper Industries, 2008). This document prescribes rules and guidance on necessary information and steps, with a delivery note that shall be received at the reception of the mill. 3) for beverage cartons no recycled content is used so far. If needed, the same guidelines used for paper shall be used in this case as they are the most suitable (beverage cartons are covered by a recovered paper grade category under theEuropean list of waste paper grades,EN643). 4) for the plastics industry: EN standard 15343:2007. This standard prescribes rules and guidelines on traceability. The supplier of the recyclate is requested to provide specific information. 4.4.8.8. Guidelines on how to deal with pre-consumer scrap When dealing with pre-consumer scrap, two options may be applied: Option 1: the impacts to produce the input material that leads to the pre-consumer scrap in question shall be allocated to the product system that generated this scrap. Scrap is claimed as pre-consumer recycled content. Process boundaries and modelling requirements applying the CFF are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6Modelling option when pre-consumer scrap is claimed as pre-consumer recycled content Option 2: Any material that circulates within a process chain or pool of process chains is excluded from being defined as recycled content and it is not included in R. Scrap is not claimed as pre-consumer recycled content. 1 Process boundaries and modelling requirements applying the CFF are shown in Figure 7.

Therefore, before selecting the appropriate R value, an evaluation of the material\u2019s recyclability shall be made 2 and the OEF study shall include astatement on the recyclability of the materials/ products. The statement on recyclability shall be provided together with an evaluation for recyclability that includes evidence for the following three criteria (as described by EN ISO 14021:2016, Section7.7.4 \u2018Evaluation methodology\u2019). 1) The collection, sorting and delivery systems to transfer the materials from the source to the recycling facility are conveniently available to a reasonable proportion of the purchasers, potential purchasers and users of the product; 2) Recycling facilities to accommodate the collected materialsexist; 3) Evidence is available to show that the product for which recyclability is claimed is being collected and recycled. For PET bottles the European PET Bottle Platform (EPBP) guidelines should be used (https://www.epbp.org/design-guidelines), while for generic plastics the recyclability by design should be used (www.recoup.org). If one criterionis not fulfilled, or the sector-specific recyclability guidelines indicate limited recyclability, an R 2 value of 0% shall be applied. Point 1) and 3) may be proven by recycling statistics, which should be country specific derived from industry associations or national bodies. Approximation to evidence at point 3) may be provided by applying for example the design for evaluating recyclability outlined in EN 13430 Material recycling (Annexes A and B) or other sector-specific recyclability guidelines if available.

When E* is different from E , the user shall provide evidence that a recyclable material is substituting a different v v. virgin material than the one producing the recyclable material. If E* \u2260 E, E* represents the actual amount of virgin material substituted by the recyclable material. In such cases v v v E* is not multiplied by Qs /Q, because this parameter is indirectly taken into account when calculating the v out p \u2018actual amount\u2018 of virgin material substituted. Such an amount shall be calculated taking into account that the virgin material substituted and the recyclable materiallast as long as each other and are of equal quality (meaning thatfulfil the same function in terms of \u2018how long\u2018 and \u2018how well\u2018).

How to apply the formula when intermediate products are included in the product porfolio The parameters related to the EoL of the intermediate products belonging to the PP (i.e. recyclability at end of life, energy recovery, disposal) shall not be accounted for. If the formula is applied in OEF studies for intermediate products (cradle-to-gate studies), the user of the OEF study shall: 1) use of Equation 3 (CFF), and 2) exclude the EoL by setting the parameters R, R, and E equal to 0, for the products in scope; 2 3 d 3) use and report the results with two A values for the product in scope: (a) Setting A = 1: to be used as the default incalculatingthe OEF profile.

Their treatment is within the E . recEoL Landfill and incineration with energy recovery Whenever a process, such as landfill with energy recovery or municipal solid waste incineration with energy recovery leads to an energy recovery, it shall be modelled under the \u2018energy\u2018 part in Equation 3 (CFF). The credit is calculated based on the amount of output energy that is used outside the process. Municipal solid waste Part C of Annex IV contains default values per country that shall be used to quantify the share going to landfill and the share going to incineration, unless supply-chain specific values are available. Compost and anaerobic digestion/ sewage treatment Compost, including digestate coming out of the anaerobic digestion, shall be treated in the \u2018material\u2018 part (Equation 3) like recycling with A = 0.5. The energy part of the anaerobic digestion shall be treated as a normal process of energy recovery under the \u2018energy\u2018 part of Equation 3(CFF). Waste materials used as fuel When waste material is used as a fuel (e.g. waste plastic used as fuel in cement kilns), it shall be treated as an energy recovery process under the \u2018energy\u2018 part of Equation3(CFF). Modelling complex products When considering complex products (e.g. printed wiring boards) with complex EoL management, the default datasets for EoLtreatment processes may already implement the CFF. The default values of the parameters shall refer to the ones in Part C of Annex IV and shall be available as metadata information in the dataset. The Bill of Material (BoM) should be taken as a starting point for calculations if no default data is available. Reuse and refurbishment If the reuse/ refurbishment of a product results in a product with different product specifications (providing another function), this shall be considered as part of the CFF, as a form of recycling. Old parts that were changed during refurbishment shall be modelled under the CFF. In this case, reuse/ refurbishment activities fall underthe E parameter, while the alternative function provided recEoL (or the avoided production of parts or components) falls under the E*v parameter. 4.4.9. Extended product lifetime Extending a product\u2019slifetime due to reuse or refurbishment of a product may result in the following: 1. A product with the original product specifications (providing the same function) In this situation, the product lifetime is extended to a product with the original product specifications (providing the same function) and shall be included in the RU and PP40and reference flow. Theuser of the OEF method shall describe how reuse or refurbishment is included in calculatingthe reference flow and the full life-cyclemodel, taking into account the \u2018how long\u2018 of the FU. 2. A product with different product specifications (providing another function). This shall be considered as part of the CFF, as a form of recycling (see Section 4.4.8.13. How to apply the formula ). Also, old parts that have been changed during refurbishment shall be modelled under the CFF. 4.4.9.1. Reuse rates (situation 1 in Section 4.4.9) The reuse rate is the number of times a material is used at the factory. This isalsooften called trip rates, reuse time or number of rotations. This may be expressed as the absolute number of reuse or as %. 40In some cases, it may be appropriate to include it in the functional unit and reference flow of the product.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/459 For example: a reuse rate of 80% equals 5 reuses.

It includes both the first use and all of the following reuses. 4.4.9.2 How to apply and model the \u2018reuse rate\u2019 (situation 1 in Section 4.4.9) The number of times a materialis reused affects theproduct\u2019senvironmental profileat different life-cyclestages. The following five steps explain how the user shall model the different life-cyclestages with reusable materials, using packaging as an example: 1. Raw material acquisition: the reuse rate determines the quantity of packaging material consumed per product sold. The raw material consumption shall be calculated by dividing the actual weight of the packaging by the number of times this packaging is reused. For example, a 1 l glass bottle weights 600 grams and is reused 10 times (reuse rate of 90%). The raw material use per litre is 60 gram (= 600 gram per bottle / 10 reuses). 2. Transport from packaging manufacturer to the product factory (where the productsare packed): The reuse rate determines the quantity of transport that is needed per product sold. The transport impact shall be calculated by dividing the one-way trip impact by the number of times the packaging is reused. 3. Transport from product factory to final client and back: in additionto the transport needed to go to the client, the return transport shall also be taken into account. To model the total transport,Section 4.4.3 on modelling transport shall be followed. 4. At the product factory: once theempty packaging is returned to the product factory, energy and resource use shall be taken into consideration as regardscleaning, repairing or refilling (if applicable). 5. Packaging EoL: the reuse rate determines the quantity of packaging material (per product sold) to be treated at the EoL. The amount of packaging treated at the EoLshall be calculated by dividing the actual weight of the packaging by the number of times this packaging was reused. 4.4.9.3. Packaging reuse rates A packaging return system is organized by: 1. the company that ownsthe packaging material (company-owned pools), or 2. athird party e.g., the government or a pooler (third party operated pools). This may influence the material\u2019s lifetime as well as the data source to be used. Therefore, it is important to separate these two return systems. For company owned packaging pools the reuse rate shall be calculated using supply chain specific data. Depending on the data available within the company, two different calculation approaches may be used (see option \u2018a\u2019 and option \u2018b\u2019 below). Returnable glass bottles are used as example but the calculations also apply for other company-owned reusable packaging. Option \u2018a\u2019: use supply-chain-specific data, based on accumulated experience over the lifetime of the previous glass bottle pool. This is the most accurate way of calculatingthe reuse rate of bottles for the previous bottle pool and is a proper estimate for the current bottle pool. The following supply chain-specific data is collected: 1. Number of bottles filled during the bottle pool\u2019s lifetime(#F) i 2. Number of bottles at initial stock plus purchased over the bottle pool\u2019s lifetime(#B) Reuse rate of the bottle pool = [Equation 5] # \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 The net glass use (kg glass/l be#v\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35erage) = [Equation 6] #\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\u00d7(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f", "embedding_index": 198}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_199", "text": "\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f) This calculation option shall be used: #\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (i) With data from the previous bottle pool when the previous and current bottle pool are comparable. meaning, the same product category, similar bottle characteristics (e.g., size), comparable return systems (e.g., way of collectionmethods, same consumer group and outlet channels), etc.\n\nL 471/460 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 (ii) With datafromthe current bottle pool when future estimations/ extrapolations are available on (i) the bottle purchases, (ii) the volumes sold, and (iii) the bottle pool\u2019s lifetime.

This impact category includes emissions from peat (used as a fuel) and calcination, and uptakes due to carbonation. Fossil CO uptake and corresponding emissions (e.g. due to carbonation) shall be modelled in a simplified way 2 when calculating the OEF profile (meaning, no emissions or uptakes shall be modelled). When knowledge about the amount of fossil CO uptake is required for additional environmental information, the CO uptake may be 2 2 modelled with the flow \u2018carbon dioxide (fossil), resources from air\u2018.

Carbon exchanges from native forests46shall be modelled under sub-category 3 (including connected soil emissions, derived products or residues). Modelling requirements: the flows falling under this definition shall be modelled consistently with the elementary flows in the most recent version of the EF package and use the flow names that end with \u2018(biogenic)\u2019. Mass allocation shall be applied to model the biogenic carbon flows. A simplified modelling approach should be used if the flows which influence the results ofclimate change impact (namely biogenic methane emissions) are modelled.

For native forests, all related CO emissions are included and modelled under this sub-category (including connected soil emissions, 2 products derived from native forests47and residues), while their CO uptake is excluded. 2 A distinction is made between direct and indirect land use change. Direct land use change occurs as the result of a transformation from one land use type into another, which takes place in a unique land cover, possibly leading to 45 For example: Let us assume that \u2018Climate change \u2013biogenic\u2019 contributes with 7% (using absolute values) to the total climate change impact and \u2018Climate change \u2013land use and land use change\u2019 contributes with 3% to the total climate change impact.

Examples of direct land use change are the conversion of land used for growing crops to industrial use or conversion from forestland to cropland. Indirect land use change occurs when a certain change in land use, or in the use of the feedstock grown on a given piece of land,causeschanges in land use outside the system boundary,i.e. in other land use types. The OEF method only considers direct land use change, while indirect land use change, due to the lack of an agreed methodology, shall not be taken into account in OEF studies. Indirect land use change may be included under additional environmental information. Modelling requirements: the flows falling under this definition shall be modelled consistently with the elementary flows in the most recent version of the EF package and use the flow names that end with \u2018(land use change)\u2019. Biogenic carbon uptakes and emissions shall be inventoried separately for each elementary flow For land use change: all carbon emissions and removals shall be modelled following the modelling guidelines of PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011) and the supplementary document PAS2050-1:2012 (BSI 2012) for horticultural products. Quoting PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011): [Large emissions of GHGs can result as a consequence of land use change. Removals as a direct result of land use change (and not as a result of long-term management practices) do not usually occur, although it is recognized that this could happen in specific circumstances. Examples of direct land use change are the conversion of land used for growing crops to industrial use or conversion from forestland to cropland. All forms of land use change that result in emissions or removals are to be included. Indirect land use change refers to such conversions of land use as a consequence of changes in land use elsewhere. While GHG emissions also arise from indirect land use change, the methods and data requirements for calculating these emissions are not fully developed. Therefore, the assessment of emissions arising from indirect land use change is not included.

The following hierarchy shall apply when determining the GHG emissions and removals arising from land use change occurring not more than 20 years or a single harvest period, prior to making the assessment (whichever is the longer): 1. where the country of production is known and the previous land use is known, the GHG emissions and removals arising from land use change shall be those resulting from the change in land use from the previous land use to the current land use in that country (additional guidelines on the calculations can be found in PAS 2050-1:2012); 48 In case of variability of production over the years, a mass allocation should be applied.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/463 2. where the country of production is known, but the former land use is not known, the GHG emissions arising from land use change shall be the estimate of average emissions from the land use change for that crop in that country (additional guidelines on the calculations can be found in PAS 2050-1:2012); 3. where neither the country of production nor the former land use is known, the GHG emissions arising from land use change shall be the weighted average of the average land use change emissions of that commodity in the countries in which it is grown. Knowledge of the prior land use can be demonstrated using a number of sources of information, such as satellite imagery and land survey data. Where records are not available, local knowledge of prior land use can be used. Countries in which a cropis grown can be determined from import statistics, and a cut-off threshold of not less than 90% of the weight of imports may be applied. Data sources, location and timing of land use change associated with inputs to products shall be reported]. Intermediate products (cradle-to-gate) derived from native forests shall always report as meta-data (in the \u2018additional technical information\u2019 Section of the OEF report) (i) their carbon content (physical content and allocated content) and (ii) that corresponding carbon emissions shall be modelled with \u2018(land use change)\u2019 elementary flows. For soil carbon stock: soil carbon emissions shall be included and modelled under this sub-category (e.g. from rice fields). Soil carbon emissions derived from aboveground residues (except from native forests) shall be modelled under sub-category 2, such as the application of non-native forest residues or straw. Soil carbon uptake (accumulation) shall be excluded from the results, e.g. from grasslands or improved land management through tilling techniques or other management measures taken related to agricultural land.

If legislation has different modelling requirements for the sector, such as the EU Decision on greenhouse gas accounting from 201349, which indicates carbon stock accounting, it shall be modelled according to the relevant legislation and provided under additional environmental information. 4.4.11 Offsets The term \u2018offset\u2019 is frequently used to refer to third-party GHG mitigation activities, e.g. regulated schemes that are part of the Kyoto Protocol (the former clean-development mechanism; joint implementation), new mechanisms discussed in the context ofnegotiations article 6 of the Paris agreement emissions trading schemes, or voluntary schemes. Offsets are GHG reductions used to compensate for (i.e., offset) GHG emissions elsewhere, for example to meet a voluntary or mandatory GHG target or cap. Offsets are calculated relative to a baseline that represents a hypothetical scenario for what emissions would have been in the absence of the mitigation project that generates the offsets. Examples are carbon offsetting by the clean development mechanism, carbon credits, and other system- external offsets. Offsets shall not be included in the impact assessment of an OEF study, but shall be reported separately as additional environmental information. 4.5 Handling multi-functional processes If a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\u2018co- products\u2018), it is \u2018multifunctional\u2018. In these situations, if the co-products are not part of the PP, all inputs and emissions linked to the process shall be partitioned between the product(s) of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner. Systems involving multi-functionality of processes shall be modelled in line with the following decision hierarchy. Specific allocation requirements in other Sections of thismethod always prevail over the ones available in this Section(e.g., Section 4.4.2on electricity 4.4.3 on transport, 4.4.10on GHG emissions, or 4.5.1on slaughterhouse activities). Decision hierarchy 1) Subdivision or system expansion 49Decision No529/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21May 2013 on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities relating to land use, land-use change and forestry and on information concerning actions relating to those activities, OJ L 165/80.\n\nL 471/464 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 As per EN ISO 14044:2006, wherever possible, subdivision or system expansion should be used to avoid allocation. Subdivision refers to disaggregating multifunctional processes or facilities to isolate the input flows directly associated with each process or facility output. System expansion refers to expanding the system by including additional functions related to the co-products. It shall be investigated first whether it is possible to subdivide or expand the analysed process. Where subdivision is possible, inventory data shall be collected only for those unit processes directly attributable50to the goods/services of concern. Or, if the system may be expanded, the additional functions shall be included in the analysis with results communicated for the expanded system as a whole rather than on an individual co-product level. 2) Allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship Where it is not possible to apply subdivision or system expansion, allocation should be applied: the inputs and outputs of the system should be partitioned between its different products or functions in a way that reflects relevant underlying physical relationships between them (EN ISO 14044:2006). Allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship refers to partitioning the input and output flows of a multi-functional process or facility in line with a relevant, quantifiable physical relationship between the process inputs and co-product outputs (for example, a physical property of the inputs and outputs that is relevant to the function provided by the co-product of interest). Allocation based on a physical relationship may be modelled using direct substitution, if it is possible to identify a product that is directly substituted. To demonstrate whether the direct substitution effect is robust, the user of the OEF methodshall prove that (1) there is a direct, empirically demonstrable substitution effect, AND (2) it is possible to model the substituted product and to subtract the LCI in a directly representative manner: if both conditions are fulfilled, model the substitution effect.

Orto allocate input/output based on some other relevant underlying physical relationship that relates the inputs and outputs to the function provided by the system, the user of the OEF method shall demonstrate that it is possible to define a relevant physical relationship by which to allocate the flows attributable to the provision of the defined function of the product system: if this condition is fulfilled, the user of the OEF method may allocate based on this physical relationship. 3) Allocation based on some other relationship Allocation based on some other relationship may be possible. For example, economic allocation refers to allocating inputs and outputs associated with multi-functional processes to the co-product outputs in proportion to their relative market values. The market price of the co-functions should refer to the specific condition and point in which the co-products are produced. In any case, a clear justification for having discarded 1) and 2) and for having selected a certain allocation rule in step 3) shall be provided, to ensure the physical representativeness of the OEF results as far as possible. Allocation based on some other relationship may be approached in one of the following alternative ways: (i) Is it possible to identify an indirect substitution51effect and may the substituted product be modelled and the inventory subtracted in a reasonably representative manner? If yes (i.e. both conditions are verified), model the indirect substitution effect. (ii) Is it possible to allocate the input/output flows between the products and functions on the basis of some other relationship (e.g. the relative economic value of the co-products)? If yes, allocate products and functions based on the relationshipidentified. The circular footprint formula (see Section4.4.8.1) provides the approach that shall be used to estimate the overall emissions that result froma certain process involving recycling and/or energy recovery. These moreover also relate to waste flows generated within the system boundary. 4.5.1 Allocation in animal husbandry This Section provides instructions on how to address specific issues related to the modelling of farm, slaughterhouse and rendering for cattle, pigs, sheep and goats. In particular, instructions are provided on: 1. allocation of upstream burdens at farm level among outputs leaving the farm; 50 Directly attributable refers to a process, activity or impact occurring within the defined system boundary. 51 Indirect substitution occurs when a product is substituted but you do not know by which products exactly.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/465 2. allocation of upstream burdens (linked to live animals) at slaughterhouse level among outputs leaving the slaughterhouse. 4.5.1.1 Allocation within the farm module At farm module, subdivision shall be used for processes that are directly allocated to certain outputs (e.g. energy use and emissions related to milking processes). If the processes cannot be subdivided due to the lack of separate data or because it is technically impossible, the upstream burden, e.g. feed production, shall be allocated to farm outputs using a biophysical allocation method. Default valuesused forallocation are provided in the following Sections for each type of animal. These default values shall be used by OEF studies unless company-specific data are collected. Changingallocation factors is only allowed if company-specific data are collected and used for the farm module. In case secondary data are used for the farm module, no change of allocation factors is allowed. 4.5.1.2 Allocation within the farm module for cattle The International Dairy Federation (IDF) (2015) allocation method between milk, cull cows and surplus calves shall be used. Dead animals and all products from dead animals shall be regarded as waste and the circular footprint formula shall be applied. In this case, however, the traceability of the products from dead animals shall be guaranteed to enable OEF studies to take this aspect into consideration. Manure exported to another farm shall be consideredasone of the following: (a) Residual (default option):if manure does not have an economic value at the farm gate, it is regarded as residual without allocation of an upstream burden. The emissions related to manure management up to farm gate are allocated to the otherfarmoutputs where manure is produced. (b) Co-product: when exported manure has an economic value at farm gate, an economic allocation of the upstream burden shall be used for manure by using the relative economic value of manure compared to milk and live animals at the farm gate. However, biophysical allocation based on IDF rules shall nevertheless be applied to allocate the remaining emissions between milk and live animals.

The data shall include all known inputs and outputs for the processes. Examples for inputs:use of energy, water, land, materials, etc. Examples of outputs:the products, co-products, emissions and waste generated. Emissions are divided into three compartments (emissions to air, to water and to soil). There are several ways to collect company-specific emission, for example, they can be based on direct measurements or calculated using company-specific activity data and related emission factors (e.g. litre of fuel consumption and emission factors for combustion in a vehicle or boiler). Whenever the sector of the product in scope is covered by EU Emission Trade System (EU ETS)monitoring rules, the user of the OEF method should follow quantification requirements as set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 for the processes and GHGs covered therein.Forcarbon capture and storage (CCS), the requirements of this Annex prevail. The data may need scaling, aggregation or other forms of mathematical treatment to bring them in line with the reporting unit. Typical specific sources of company-specific data are: (a) process-or plant-level consumption data; 62 Based on the OEF screening study (v 1.0, November 2015) of the meat pilot, available at https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=81474527\n\nL 471/472 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 (b) bills and stock/ inventory changes of consumables; (c) emission measurements (amounts and concentrations of emissions from flue gas and wastewater); (d) composition of products and", "embedding_index": 216}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_217", "text": ") of the meat pilot, available at https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=81474527\n\nL 471/472 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 (b) bills and stock/ inventory changes of consumables; (c) emission measurements (amounts and concentrations of emissions from flue gas and wastewater); (d) composition of products and waste; (e) procurement and sale department(s)/ unit(s). All new datasets created when conducting an OEF study shall be EFcompliant. All company-specific data shall be modelled in company-specific datasets. 4.6.2 Secondary data Secondary data refer to data that are not based on direct measurements or on calculation of the respective processes in the system boundary. Secondary data areeither sector-specific, i.e. specific to the sector being considered for the OEF study, or multi-sector. Examples of secondary data include: (a) data from literature or scientific papers; (b) industry average life-cycledata from LCI databases, industry association reports, government statistics, etc. All secondary data shall be modelled in secondary datasetswhichshall fulfil the data hierarchy in Section4.6.3 and the quality requirements specified in Section4.6.5. The sources of thesedata usedshall be clearly documented and reported in the OEF report. 4.6.3 Datasets to be used OEF studies shall use secondary datasets that are EF compliant, when available. To develop secondary EF compliant datasets, the Guide for EF compliant datasets shall be followed64. Ifan EF compliant secondary dataset does not exist or cannot be developed, the selection of the datasets to be used shall be done according to the following rules, provided in hierarchical order: 1. use an EF compliant proxy (if available); the use of proxy datasets shall be reported in the limitations sectionof the OEF report. 2. use an ILCD entry level (EL) compliant dataset as aproxy65.A maximum of 10% of the single overall score may be derived from ILCD-EL compliant datasets . 3. if no EF compliant or ILCD-EL compliant dataset is available, then the process shall be excluded from the model. This shall be clearly stated in the in the \u2018limitations\u2018sectionof the OEF report as a data gap and validated bythe verifier. 4.6.4 Cut-off Any cut-off shall be avoided, unless under the following rules: Processes and elementary flows may be excluded up to 3.0% (cumulatively)based on material and energy flows and the level of environmental significance (single overall score). The processes subject to cut-off shall be made explicit and justified in the OEF report, in particular with reference to the environmental significance of the cut- off applied. This cut-off has to be considered in addition to the cut-off already included in the background datasets. This rule is valid for both intermediate and final products. The processes that in total(cumulatively)accountforless than 3.0% of the material and energy flow as well as the environmental impact for each impact category may be excluded from OEF study. A screening study is recommended to identify processes that may be subject to cut-off. 64 seehttps://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/permalink/Guide_EF_DATA.pdf 65 In case an ILCD-EL compliant dataset is used, the nomenclature of the elementary flows shall be aligned with the EF reference package used by the EF compliant datasets in the rest of the model (available on the EF developer\u2019s page at the following link http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml).\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/473 4.6.5 Data quality requirements This Section describes how the data quality of EF compliant datasets shall be assessed. The data quality requirements are presented in Table 20. \u2022 Two minimum requirements, (i) completeness, (ii) methodological appropriateness and consistency. Once the processes and products are chosen, which represent the system analysed, and their LCIs are inventoried, the completeness criterion evaluates how muchthe LCI covers all the emissions and resources of the processes and products that are required to calculate all EF impact categories. Fulfilling the completeness criterion as well as being fully in line with the OEF method is a pre-requisite for EF compliant datasets. Therefore these two criteria are not qualitatively rated. The Guide for EF compliant data sets explains how they shall be reported in the data set66. \u2022 Four quality criteria: technological, geographical, time-related representativeness, and precision.

The DQR of the sub-processes shall be assessed through the Data Needs Matrix. The DQR of the newly developed dataset shall be calculated as follows: 1. Select the most-relevantactivity data and direct elementary flows: most-relevantactivity data are those linked to sub-processes (i.e. secondary datasets)accountingfor at least 80% of the total environmental impact of the company-specific dataset. List them in order, from those whichcontribute the mostto those which contribute the least. Most-relevantdirect elementary flows are defined as those which contribute cumulatively at least with 80% to the total impact of the direct elementary flows. 2. Calculate the DQR criteria -TeR, TiR, GeR and P-for each type of the most-relevantactivity data and each type of most-relevantdirect elementary flow using Table 23. a. Each most-relevantdirect elementary flow consists of the amount and elementary flow naming (e.g. 40 g CO). For each most-relevant elementary flow, the 4 DQR criteria-TeR , TiR , 2 -EF -EF GeR , P -shall be evaluated (e.g. the timing of the flow measured, for which technology the -EF EF flow was measured and in which geographical area). b.

Considering that both activity data and direct elementary flows shall be company specific, the score of P cannot be higher than 3 while the score for TiR, TeR, and GeR cannot be higher than 2 (the DQR score shall be \u22641.5). 3. Calculate as a percentage the environmental contribution of each most-relevant activity data (bylinking to the appropriate sub-process) and direct elementary flow to the total sum of the environmental impact of all most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows, (weighted, using all EF impact categories).

Calculate as a percentage the environmental contribution of each most-relevant activity data (bylinking to the appropriate sub-process) and direct elementary flow to the total sum of the environmental impact of all most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows, (weighted, using all EF impact categories). For example, the newly developed dataset has only two most-relevantactivity data, contributing to 80% of the total environmental impact of the dataset: Activity data 1 carries 30% of the total dataset environmental impact.

Environmental footprint impact assessment Once the LCI has been compiled, the EF impact assessment76shall be carried outto calculate the environmental performance of the product, using all the EF impact categories and models. EF impact assessment includes four steps: classification, characterisation, normalisation and weighting. Results of an OEF study shall be calculated and reported in the OEF report as characterised, normalised and weighted results for each EF impact category and as a single overall score based on the weighting factors provided in Section6.5.2.2. Results shall be reported for (i) the total life-cycle, and (ii) the total life-cycleexcluding the use stage. 5.1. Classification and characterisation 5.1.1 Classification Classification requires assigning the material/ energy inputs and outputs inventoried in the LCI to the relevant EF impact category. For example, during the classification phase, all inputs/ outputs that result in GHG emissions are assigned to the climate change category. Similarly, those that result in emissions of ozone-depleting substances are assigned to the ozone depletion category. In some cases, an input or output may contribute to more than one EF impact category (for example, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) contribute to both climate change and ozone depletion). It is important to express the data in terms of the constituent substances for which characterisation factors (see next Section) are available. For example, data for a composite NPK fertiliser shall be disaggregated and classified according to its N, P, and K fractions, because each constituent element will contribute to different EF impact categories. In practice, much of the LCI data may be drawn from existing public or commercial LCI databases, where classification has already been implemented. In such cases, it must be assured, e.g.by the provider, that the classification and linked EF impact assessment pathways correspond to the requirements of the OEF method. All inputs and outputs inventoried while the LCI is being compiled shallbe assigned to the EF impact categories to which they contribute using the classification data made available by the European Commission JRC77. As part of the classification of the LCI, data should be expressed in terms of constituent substances for which characterisation factors are available, as far as possible. 5.1.2 Characterisation Characterisation refers to the calculatingof the magnitude of the contribution of each classified input and output to their respective EF impact categories, and aggregatingof the contributions within each category. This is carried out by multiplying the values in the LCI by the relevant characterisation factor for each EF impact category. The characterisation factors are substance-or resource-specific. They represent the impactintensity of a substance relative to a common reference substance for an EF impact category (impact category indicator). For example, whencalculating climate change impacts, all GHG emissions inventoried in the LCI are weighted in terms of their impact intensity relative to carbon dioxide, which is the reference substance for this category. This allows for the impact potentials and expression to be aggregated in terms of a single equivalent substance (in this case, CO 2 equivalents) for each EF impact category. All classified inputs and outputs in each EF impact category shall be assigned characterisation factors representing the contribution per unit of input or output to the category, using the provided characterisation factors78. EF impact assessment results shall subsequently be calculated for each EF impact category by multiplying the amount of each input/output by", "embedding_index": 223}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_224", "text": " the reference substance for this category. This allows for the impact potentials and expression to be aggregated in terms of a single equivalent substance (in this case, CO 2 equivalents) for each EF impact category. All classified inputs and outputs in each EF impact category shall be assigned characterisation factors representing the contribution per unit of input or output to the category, using the provided characterisation factors78. EF impact assessment results shall subsequently be calculated for each EF impact category by multiplying the amount of each input/output by its characterisation factor and summing the contributions of all inputs/outputs within each category to obtain a single measure expressed inthe appropriate reference units. 76 The EF Impact Assessment does not intend to replace other (regulatory) methods that have a different scope and objective suchas (Environmental) Risk Assessment ((E)RA), site-specific Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or health and safety regulations at product level or related to safety at the workplace. In particular, the EF Impact Assessment does not have the objective of predicting if at any specific location at any specific time thresholds are exceeded and actual impacts occur. In contrast, it describes the existing pressures on the environment. Thus, the EF Impact Assessment is complementary to other well-proven tools, adding the life-cycle perspective 77 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 78 Available online at http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/481 5.2. Normalisation and weighting Following the steps of classification and characterisation, the EF impact assessment shall be complemented with normalisation and weighting. 5.2.1 Normalisation of environmental footprint impact assessment results Normalisation is the step in which the LCIA results are divided by normalisation factors to calculate and compare the magnitude of their contributions to the EF impact categories relative to a reference unit. As a result, dimensionless, normalised results are obtained. These reflect the burdens that are attributedto a product relative to the reference unit. Within the OEF method the normalisation factors are expressed per capita based on a global value79. Normalised environmental footprint results do not, however, indicate the severity or relevance of the respective impacts. In OEF studies, normalised results shall not be aggregated as this implicitly applies weighting. Characterised results shall be reported alongside the normalised results. 5.2.2 Weighting of environmental footprint impact assessment results Weighting is a mandatory step in OEF studies and it supports the interpretation and communication of the analysis results. In this step, normalised results are multiplied by a set of weighting factors (in %) which reflect the perceived relative importance of the life-cycle impact categories considered. Weighted results of different impact categories may then be compared to assess their relative importance. They may also be aggregated across life- cycle impact categories to obtain a single overall score, expressed in points. The underpinning process to develop the weighting factors is reported in Sala et al. 2018. The weighting factors80 that shall be used in OEF studies are provided online 8182. The results of the EF impact assessment prior to weighting (i.e. characterised and normalised) shall be reported alongside weighted results in the OEF report. 79 The EF normalisation factors to be used are available at http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 80 For more information on existing weighting approaches in OEF, please refer to the reports developed by the JRC available online at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/documents/2018_JRC_Weighting_EF.pdf 81 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml 82 Please note that the weighting factors are expressed in % and thus shall be divided by 100 before applying in the calculations.\n\nL 471/482 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 6. Interpretation of organisation environmental foootprint results 6.1. Introduction Interpretatingof the results of the OEF study serves two purposes: 1. Firstly, to ensure that the performance of the OEF model corresponds to the study\u2019s goals and quality requirements. In this sense, life-cycle interpretation may inform iterative improvements of the OEF model until all goals and requirements are met; 2. Secondly,to derive robust conclusions and recommendations from the analysis, for example,in support of environmental improvements. To meet these objectives, the interpretation phase shall include the steps outlined in this Section. 6.2.

Secondly,to derive robust conclusions and recommendations from the analysis, for example,in support of environmental improvements. To meet these objectives, the interpretation phase shall include the steps outlined in this Section. 6.2. Assessment of the robustness of the organisation environmental footprint model Assessing the robustness of the OEF model evaluates the extent to which methodological choices such as the system boundary, data sources, and allocation choices influence the analytical outcomes. Tools that should be used to assess the OEF model\u2019srobustness includethe following: (a) Completeness checks: to assess the LCI data to ensure that it is complete relative to the defined goals, scope, system boundary and quality criteria. This includes completeness of process coverage (i.e. all processes at each supply chain stage considered have been included) and input/output coverage (i.e. all material or energy inputs and emissions associated with each process have been included). (b) Sensitivity checks: to assess the extent to which the results are determined by specific methodological choices, and the impact of implementing alternative choices where these can be identified. It is useful to structure sensitivity checks for each phase of the OEF study, including goal and scope definition, the LCI, and the EF impact assessment. (c) Consistency checks: to assess the extent to which assumptions, methods, and data quality considerations have been applied consistentlythroughout the OEF study. Any issues flagged in this evaluation may be used to inform iterative improvements to the OEF study. 6.3. Identification of hotspots: most-relevantimpact categories, life-cycle stages, processes and elementary flows Once the user of the OEF method ensures that the OEF model is robust and conforms to all aspects defined in the goal and scope definition phases, the main contributing elements to the OEF results shall be identified. This step may also be referred to as \u2018hotspot\u2018 analysis.The user of the OEF method shall identify and list in the OEF report (together with the %) the most-relevant: 1. impact categories, 2. life cycle stages (mandatory if the PP is made of products. Optional if the PP includes services), 3. processes, and 4. elementaryflows. There is an important operational difference between most-relevantimpact categories, and life-cyclestages on one hand and most-relevant processes, and elementary flows on the other. In particular, most-relevant impact categories and life-cycle stages may be mainly relevant in the context of communicatingthe results of an OEF study. They might serve tohighlightenvironmental areas where the organisation \u2018should focus their attention. Identifyingthe most-relevantprocesses and elementary flows is more important for the engineers and designers to identify actions for improving the overall footprint e.g. by-passing or changing a process, further optimising a process, or applyinganti-pollution technology. This is particularly relevant for internal studies, to look deeper into how to improve the product\u2019s environmental performance. The procedure that shall be followed to identify the\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/483 most-relevant impact categories, life-cyclestages, processes and elementary flows isdescribed in the following Sections. 6.3.1 Procedure to identify the most-relevant impact categories The identification of the most-relevantimpact categories shall be based on the normalised and weighted results. The most-relevantimpact categories shall be identified as allof thoseimpact categories thattogethercontribute to at least 80%to the single overall score. This shall start from the largest to the smallest contributions. At least three relevant impact categories shall be identified as most-relevantones. The user of the OEF method may add more impact categories to the list of the most-relevant ones but none shall be deleted. 6.3.2 Procedure to identify the most-relevant life-cycle stages The most-relevant life-cycle stages are thosethat together contribute to at least 80%to any of the most-relevant impact categories identified. This shall start from the largest to the smallest contributions. The user of the OEF method may add more life-cycle stages to the list of the most-relevant ones but none shall be deleted. As a minimum, the life-cyclestages described at Section4.2 shall be considered. If the use stage accounts for more than 50% of the total impact of a most-relevantimpact category, the procedure shall be re-run with the exclusion of the use stage. In this case, the list of most-relevantlife-cyclestages shall be those selected through the latter procedure plus the use stage. 6.3.3 Procedure to identify the most-relevant processes Each most-relevantimpact category", "embedding_index": 225}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_226", "text": ", the life-cyclestages described at Section4.2 shall be considered. If the use stage accounts for more than 50% of the total impact of a most-relevantimpact category, the procedure shall be re-run with the exclusion of the use stage. In this case, the list of most-relevantlife-cyclestages shall be those selected through the latter procedure plus the use stage. 6.3.3 Procedure to identify the most-relevant processes Each most-relevantimpact category shall be further investigated by identifying the most-relevantprocesses used to model the product in scope. The most-relevantprocesses are those that collectively contribute to at least 80% to any of the most-relevantimpact categories identified. Identical processes83taking place in different life-cycle stages (e.g. transportation, electricity use) shall be accounted for separately. Identical processes taking place within the same life-cyclestage shall be accounted for together. The list of most-relevantprocesses shall be reported in the OEF report together with the respective life-cyclestage (or multiple life-cyclestages if relevant) and the table 26 Table 26Criteria to select at which life-cyclestage level to identify the most-relevantprocesses Contribution of the use stage to the total Most-relevantprocesses identified at the level of impact of a most-relevantimpact category \u2265 50% whole life-cycleexcluding use stage, and use stage < 50% whole life-cycle This analysis shall be reported separately for each most-relevantimpact category. The user of the OEF method may add more processes to the list of the most-relevantones but none shall be deleted. 6.3.4 Procedure to identify the most-relevant elementary flows The most-relevantelementary flows are defined as those elementary flows that together contribute at least 80%to the total impact of each most-relevant specific impact category for each most-relevantprocesses, starting from thosethat contribute the mostto thosethatcontribute the least. This analysis shall be reported separately for each most-relevantimpact category. Elementary flows belonging to the background system of a most-relevant process may dominate the impact. Therefore, if disaggregated datasets are available, the user of the OEF method should also identify the most- relevantdirect elementary flows for each most-relevantprocess. Most-relevantdirect elementary flows are defined as those direct elementary flows that together contributeat least with 80%to the total impact of the direct elementary flows of the process, for each most-relevantimpact category. The analysis shall be limited to the direct emissions of the level-1 disaggregated datasets84. This means that the 83 Two processes are identical when they have the same UUID. 84 Seehttp://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml) for description of level-1 disaggregated datasets\n\nL 471/484 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 80% cumulative contribution shall be calculated against the impact caused by the direct emissions only, and not against the total impact of the process. The user of the OEF method may add more elementary flows to the list of thosethat aremost-relevantbut none shall be deleted. The list of most-relevantelementary flows (or, if applicable, direct elementary flows) per most- relevantprocess shall be reported in the OEF report. 6.3.5 Dealing with negative numbers When identifying the percentage impact contribution for any process or elementary flow, it is important that absolute values be used. This makes it possible to identify the relevance of any credits (e.g., from recycling). In case of processes or flows with a negative impact score, the following procedure shall be applied: (a) consider the absolute values (i.e. impacts of processes or flows to have a plus sign, namely a positive score), (b) the total impact score needs to be recalculated including the converted negative scores, (c) the total impact score is set to 100%, (d) the percentage impact contribution for any process or elementary flow is assessed to this new total.

Organisation environmental footprint reports 7.1. Introduction An OEF report complements the OEF study providing a relevant, comprehensive, consistent, accurate, and transparent summary of the OEF study. It reproducesthe best possible information in such a way as to maximise its usefulness to intended current and future users, whilst transparently communicating the limitations. Effective OEF reporting requires that several criteria, both procedural (report quality) and substantive (report content), are met. An OEF report template is available in Part E of the Annex IV. This template includes the minimum information to be reported in an OEF report. At a minimum, anOEF report consists of:a summary, the main report, the aggregated EF compliant dataset and an annex. Confidential and proprietary information may be documented in a fourth item - a complementary confidential report. Review reports are annexed. 7.1.1. Summary Thesummary shall be able to stand alone without compromising the results and conclusions/recommendations (if included). The summary shall fulfil the same criteria about transparency, consistency, etc. as the detailed report. To the extent possible, the summary should be written targeting a non-technical audience. 7.1.2. Aggregated EF compliant dataset For each product in scope of the OEF study, the user shall make an aggregated EF compliant datasetavailable If the user of the OEF method or of the OEFSR publishes such an EF compliant dataset, the OEF report on the basis of which the dataset is generated shall also be made public. 7.1.3. Main report The main report85shall, as a minimum, include the following components: 1. general information, 2. goal of the study, 3. scope of the study, 4. life-cycleinventory analysis, 5. life-cycleimpact assessment results, 6. interpreting OEF results. 7.1.4. Validation statement See Section8.5.3 7.1.5. Annexes The annexes serve to document supporting elements to the main report which are of a more technical nature (e.g detailed calculations for data quality assessment, alternative approach for nitrogen field model when an OEF study has agricultural modelling in scope, results of sensitivity analysis, assessment of the OEF model\u2019s robustness, bibliographic references). 7.1.6. Confidential report The confidential report is an optional. If used, it shall contain all data (including raw data) and information that are confidential or proprietary and may not be made externally available. The confidential report shall be made available for the verification and validation procedure of the OEF study (see Section 8.4.3). 85 The main report, as defined here, is insofar as possible in line with EN ISO 14044:2006requirements on reporting for studies which do not contain comparative assertions to be disclosed to the public.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/489 8. Verification and validation of OEF studies, reports, and communication vehicles Ifpolicies on implementing the OEF method define specific requirements as regardsverification and validation of OEF studies, reports and communication vehicles, then theserequirements in said policies shall prevail. 8.1. Defining the scope of the verification The verification and validation of the OEF study is mandatory whenever the study, or part of the information therein, is used for any type of external communication (i.e. communication to any interested party other than the commissioner or the user of the OEF method of the study). Verification means the conformity assessment process carried out by", "embedding_index": 228}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_229", "text": " and validation of OEF studies, reports and communication vehicles, then theserequirements in said policies shall prevail. 8.1. Defining the scope of the verification The verification and validation of the OEF study is mandatory whenever the study, or part of the information therein, is used for any type of external communication (i.e. communication to any interested party other than the commissioner or the user of the OEF method of the study). Verification means the conformity assessment process carried out by an environmental footprint verifier(s) to check whether the OEF study has been carried out in compliance with Annex III. Validationmeans the confirmation by the environmental footprint verifier(s) who carried out the verification, that the information and data included in the OEF study, the OEF report and the communication vehicles available at the time of validation process are reliable, credible and correct. The verification and validation shall cover the following three areas: 1. the OEF study (including, but not limited to the data collected, calculated, and estimated and the underlying model); 2. the OEF report; 3. the technical content of the communication vehicles, if applicable. The verification of the OEF study shall ensure that the OEF study is conducted in compliance with Annex III or the applicable OEFSR. The validation of information in the OEF study shall ensure that: (a) the data and information used for the OEF study are consistent, reliable and traceable; (b) the calculations performed do not include significant86mistakes. The verification and validation of the OEF report shall ensure that: (a) the OEF report is complete, consistent, and compliant with the OEF report template provided in Part E of Annex IV; (b) the information and data included are consistent, reliable and traceable; (c) the mandatory information and Sections are included and appropriately filled in; (d) all the technical information that could be used for communication purposes, independently from the communication vehicle to be used, are included in the report. Note: confidential information shall bevalidated, while itmay be excluded from the OEF report. The validation of the technical content of the communication vehicle content shall ensure that: (a) the technical information and data included are reliable and consistent with the information included in the OEF study and in the OEF report; (b) that the information is compliant with the requirements of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive87; (c) that the communication vehicle complies with the principles of transparency, availability and accessibility, reliability, completeness, comparability and clarity, as described in the Commission Communication on Building the Single Market for Green Products88. 86 Mistakes are significant if they change the final result by more than 5% for any of the impact categories, or the identified most-relevant impact categories, life-cyclestages and processes. 87 Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (\u2018Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\u2019) 88 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52013DC0196\n\nL 471/490 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 8.2.

Validity of the verification and validation report and the validation statement A verification and validation report, and a validation statement shall refer to one specific OEF report only. The verification and validation report and the validation statement shall clearly identify the specific OEF study under verification (i.e. by including the title, the commissioner of the OEF study, the user of the OEF method, etc. \u2013see Sections 8.5.1 and 8.5.2), together with the explicit version of the final OEF report to which the verification and validation report and a validation statement apply (e.g. by including the report date, the version number, etc.). Both the verification and validation report and the validation statement shall be completed based on the final OEF report, after the implementation of all the corrective actions requested by the verifier(s). They shall carry the handwritten or electronic signature of the verifier(s) in line with Regulation (EU) n\u00b0 910/201493. The maximum validity of the verification and validation report and of the validation statement shall not exceed three years starting from their issue date. During the validity period of the verification, surveillance (follow-up) shall be agreed between the commissioner of the OEF study and the verifier(s) to evaluate if the content is still consistent with the current situation (the suggested periodicity for this follow-up is once per year, to be agreed between the OEF study commissioner and the verifier(s)). The periodic checks shall focus on the parameters that according to the verifier(s) might lead to relevant changes in the results of the OEF study. This means, that the results shall be recalculated considering the changes of the identified parameters.The list of such parameters includes: \u2022 bill of material/ bill of components; \u2022 energy mix used for processes in Situation1 of the Data Needs Matrix; \u2022 change of packaging; \u2022 changes in the suppliers (materials/ geography); \u2022 changes in the logistics; \u2022 relevant technological changes in the processes in situation 1 of the Data Needs Matrix. At the time of the periodic check the reasons for non-disclosure of information should also be reconsidered. The surveillance verification may be organised as a document check and/or through on-site inspections. Regardless of the validity, the OEF study (and consequently the OEF report) shall be updated during the surveillance period if the results of one of the impact categories communicated has worsened by more than 10.0% 93Regulation N\u00b0 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, OJEU L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73.\n\nL 471/496 EN Official JourialJfl thl ou", "embedding_index": 234}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_235", "text": " impact categories communicated has worsened by more than 10.0% 93Regulation N\u00b0 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, OJEU L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73.\n\nL 471/496 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 compared to the verified data, or if the total aggregated score has worsened by more than 5.0% compared to the verified data.

OEFSRs aim at increasing the reproducibility, relevance, focus, efficiency and consistency of OEF studies An OEFSR should be developed and written in a format that persons with technical knowledge (in LCA as well as with regard to the considered product category) can understand and canuse to conduct an OEF study. Each OEFSR shall implement the materiality principle, meaning that an OEF study shall focus on those aspects and parameters that are the most-relevantfor the environmental performance of a given product. By doing this the time, effort and cost of carrying out the analysis is reduced. Each OEFSR shall specify the minimum list of processes (mandatory processes) that shall always be modelled with company-specific data. The purpose is to avoid that users of the OEFSR are able toperform an OEF study and communicate its results without having access to the relevant company-specific (primary) data and by using only default data. The OEFSR shall define this mandatory list of processes based on their relevance and the possibility to have access to company-specific data. The definitions provided under the Annex III are applicable also for this Annex. A.1.1. Relationship between OEFSRs and PEFCRs Typically, OEFSRs tend to be wider in scope than PEFCRs (e.g. relationship between retail sector and one specific food product). Furthermore, OEFSRs are considering some aspects that are normally out of the boundaries of a PEF study compliant with a PEFCR (e.g. impacts related to company services, such as marketing). At the same time, there is a needto ensure consistency between the methodological choices made in correlated OEFSRs and PEFCRs. In theory, the sum of the PEFs of the products provided by an organisation over a certain reporting interval (e.g. 1 year) should be close to its OEF for the same reporting interval. The development of an OEFSR shall take into account existing PEFCRs: in case there is an existing PEFCR covering a product, material or component belonging to the Product Portfolio (PP), all the rules and assumptions used in the PEFCR, including the related EF-compliantdataset, shall be used for modelling that element in the PP. Exceptions to this rule shall be agreed with the EC. A.1.2. How to manage modularity In case the PP contains intermediate products, the PEFCR may become a \u201cmodule\u201d to be used when developing OEFSRs which include in their PP products further down the supply chain. This is equally applicable if the intermediate product can be used in different supply chains (e.g. metal sheets). The development of \u201cmodules\u201d allows for ahigher level of consistency among different supply chains that are using the same modules as part of their LCA. The possibility to build such modules should always be considered also for final products, belonging to the PP, especially for those products that share part of the production chain and then differentiate due to different functions (e.g. detergents). There are different scenarios that may require a modular approach: (a) The PP includes a final product using in its BoM an intermediate product for which there is already an existing OEFSR (e.g. car production with leather upholstery) or a final product that becomes part of the life-cycleof another product (e.g. detergent used to wash a T-shirt); (b) The PP includes a final product using a component or product that is already used as a component by another PEFCR/OEFSR (e.g. fittings to be used in piping systems, fertilisers). 94 Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organisations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment(2010), available at: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/dev_methods.htm", "embedding_index": 245}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_246", "text": ". detergent used to wash a T-shirt); (b) The PP includes a final product using a component or product that is already used as a component by another PEFCR/OEFSR (e.g. fittings to be used in piping systems, fertilisers). 94 Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organisations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment(2010), available at: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/dev_methods.htm\n\nL 471/512 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 For scenario (a), the new OEFSR shall define how to manage the productinformation based on the environmental relevance of the product and the DNM (see Section4.4.4.4). This means that if the product is \u2018most-relevant\u2018and it is under the company\u2019s control, company-specific data shall be requested, following the rules of the PEFCR having the module in its scope95. If it is not under the company\u2019s operational control but amongst the \u2018most- relevant\u2018processes, the user of the OEFSR may choose either to provide company-specific data, or to use the EF compliant secondary dataset96provided with the PEFCR that has the module in its scope. In scenario (b), the Technical Secretariat (see the role and the membership in Section A.2.2.) shall assess the feasibility of implementing the same modelling assumptions and secondary datasets listed in the existing PEFCR/OEFSR. If feasible, the Technical Secretariat shall implement the same modelling assumptions and dataset to be used in its own OEFSR. If not feasible, the Technical Secretariat shall agree on a solution with the Commission. 95 In case the already existing OEFSRused as a module is updated during the validity of the OEFSRrelying on it, the old version prevails and stays valid for the duration of the validity of the newly developed OEFSR. 96 This is a mandatory deliverable for any representative organisationdeveloped in a OEFSR.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/513 A.2. The process of developing and revising an OEFSR The provisions of this Sectionare without prejudice of provisions to be included in future EU legislation. This Sectionincludes the process for developing and revising an OEFSR. The following situations might occur: Development of a new OEFSR; (a) Full revision of an existing OEFSR; (b) Partial revision of an existing OEFSR. For cases (a) and (b) the procedure described in this Section(see figure A-1) shall be followed. Case (c) is only allowed if the model of the Representative Organisation (RO), (see SectionA.2.3.) is updatedwith corrected/new data or datasets and correction of obvious mistakes, and the results of the RO change with a certain maximum: (i) LCIA results change <10% per impact category (characterized results), and (ii) LCIA results change <5% of the single overall score, and (iii)the list of most-relevantimpact categories, life-cyclestages, processes, and direct elementary flows don\u2019t change. If results of the ROchange >10% for at least one impact category (characterized results) or > 5% of the single overall score, case (c) is not applicable and a full revision of the OEFSR is required. In case (c) the Technical Secretariat shall provide an updated OEFSR to the panel review and the last three steps of Figure A-1 shall be followed (i.e. panel review, final draft OEFSR, final approval of the OEFSR).

Who can develop an OEFSR A Technical Secretariat shall be set up to develop an OEFSR. The Technical Secretariat shall represent at least 51% of the EU consumption market (sold) in terms of economic turnover. The Technical Secretariat shall achieve this market coverage directly by companies participating in it and/or indirectly, through the EU market coverage of members represented by a business association. The Technical Secretariat shall submit a confidential report proving market coverage to the Commission when establishing the Technical Secretariat. A.2.2. Role of the Technical Secretariat The Technical Secretariat (TS) is responsible for the following activities: (a) Drafting the OEFSR in compliance", "embedding_index": 246}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_247", "text": " (sold) in terms of economic turnover. The Technical Secretariat shall achieve this market coverage directly by companies participating in it and/or indirectly, through the EU market coverage of members represented by a business association. The Technical Secretariat shall submit a confidential report proving market coverage to the Commission when establishing the Technical Secretariat. A.2.2. Role of the Technical Secretariat The Technical Secretariat (TS) is responsible for the following activities: (a) Drafting the OEFSR in compliance with the rules included in Annex III and this Annex; (b) Harmonisation with existing sectorial rules or PEFCRs ;\n\nL 471/514 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 (c) Organising public consultations on draft versions of the documents, analysis of comments, and providing written feedback; (d) Co-ordinating the supporting studies; (e) Managing the public online platform for the respective OEFSR. This activity includes tasks such as the drafting of publicly available explanatory materials related to the OEFSR, online consultations on drafts and publishing of feedback on stakeholder comments; (f) Ensuring the selection and appointment of competent independent OEFSR review panel members. A.2.3. Definition of the representative organisation(s) The Technical Secretariat shall develop a \u2018model\u2018of the representative organisation (RO) present on the EU market and belonging to the sector. The RO shall reflect the current situation, at the time of developing the OEFSR. This means, for example, that future technologies, future transport scenarios or future end of life treatments shall be excluded. The data used shall reflect realistic market averages and be most recent (especially for fast developing technology products). Conservative values or estimates shall be avoided. The RO may be a real or a virtual (non-existing) organisation. The virtual organisation should be calculated based on average European market sales-weighted characteristics of all existing technologies/production process/organisation types covered by the sector or sub-sector. Other weighting sets may be used, if justified.. When identifying the RO there is the risk that different technologies with very different market shares get mixed up and the ones with a relatively small market share might be overlooked. In such cases the Technical Secretariat shall include the missing technologies/production routes/ organisation types (if in scope) in the definition of the RO or provide written justification if this is not technically possible. The RO is the basis for the OEF study of the representative organisation (OEF-RO). SectionA.3.1 explains for when a RO shall be developed for sectors and subsectors. The technical secretariat shall provide information about all the steps taken to define the \u2018model\u2019 of the RO and report the information gathered in an Annex to the OEFSR. The Technical Secretariat take the most appropriate measuresto preserve the confidentiality of data, if applicable. A.2.4. First OEF study of the representative organisation(s) A first OEF study shall be carried out on each representative organisation (first OEF-RO). The first OEF-RO aims at: 1. Identifying the most-relevantimpact categories; 2. Identifying the most-relevantlife-cyclestages, processes and elementary flows; 3. Identifying data needs, data collection activities and data quality requirements. The Technical Secretariat carries out the first OEF-RO on the \u2018model\u2018of the RO(s). Lack of available data and low market shares shall not be an argument for exclusions of technologies or production processes. The Technical Secretariat shall use EF compliant datasets for the OEF-RO, if available. If an EF compliant dataset does not exist, the following procedure shall be followed in hierarchical order: 1. If an EF compliant proxy can be found it shall be used; 2. If an ILCD-EL compliantdataset asproxy can be found: it shall be used but shall not be included in the list of default datasets of the first draft OEFSR. The proxy shall be listed in the limitations of the first draft OEFSR with the following text: \u2018This dataset is used as a proxy during the first OEF-RO only. However, the company performing the supporting study to test the first draft OEFSR shall apply an EF compliant dataset, if available (following the rules laid out in SectionA.4.4.2on which datasetsto use). If this is not available, the company shall use the same proxy as used for calculatingthe first OEF-RO\u2018 3. If no EF compliant or ILCD-EL compliant datasetcan be found, another dataset may be used. In the first OEF-RO no cut-off of processes, emissions to the environment and resources from the environment is allowed. All the life-cyclestages and processes shall be covered (includingcapital goods).

In the first OEF-RO no cut-off of processes, emissions to the environment and resources from the environment is allowed. All the life-cyclestages and processes shall be covered (includingcapital goods). However, activities like staff commuting, canteens at production sites, consumables not strictly related to production processes, marketing, business trips and R&D activities may be excluded. Cut-offs may only be included in the final OEFSRbased on the rules included in the Annex III and this Annex.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/515 A first OEF-RO report shall be provided (following template in part E of the Annex IV) and shall include the characterised, normalised and weighted results. The first OEF-RO and its report shall be verifiedby the review panel and a public review report shall be provided as its annex. A.2.5. First draft OEFSR Based on the results of the first OEF-RO the Technical Secretariat shall produce a first draft OEFSR,used to carry out the OEFSR supporting studies. It shall be drafted according to the requirements included in this Annex and the template provided in part B of this Annex. It shall include all the requirements needed for the supporting studies, with particular reference to company-specific data collection tables and procedures. A.2.6. Supporting studies The goal of the supporting studies is to test the implementabilityof the first draft OEFSR and, to a lesser extent, provide indications about the suitability of the identified most-relevant impact categories, life-cycle stages, processes and direct elementary flows. For each RO at least three OEF supporting studies shall be carried out. The supporting studies shall be in compliance with all requirements included in the first draft OEFSR and the version of this Annex it refers to. The following additional rules shall be followed: \u2022 No cut-off is allowed; \u2022 Each study shall implement the hotspot analysis described in Section6.3 of this Annex and A.6.1 of this Annex. Each study shall be carried out on real organisation as currently present in the European market; \u2022 To better analyse the applicability of the first draft OEFSR, the studies shall be carried out on (i) organisation of different sizes, including at least one SME if present in the sector; (ii) organisations characterized by different production processes/ technologies; and (iii) organisations with the main production processes (i.e. the ones for which company-specific data are collected) located in different countries. Each supporting study shall be carried out by an entity97that is neither involved in the drafting of the OEFSR nor is part of the review panel. Exceptions to this rule may exist but they have to be in agreement with the European Commission. No aggregated EF compliant dataset has to be made available to the European Commission An OEF report shall complement each supporting study and provide a relevant, comprehensive, consistent, accurate, and transparent summary of the study. The OEF report template to be used for the supporting studies template is available in part E of this Annex. The template includes the minimum information to be reported. The supporting studies (and their related OEF report) are confidential. They shall only be shared with the European Commission or the body overseeing the OEFSR development, and the review panel. However, the company performing the supporting study may decide to grant access to other stakeholders. A.2.7. Second OEF study of the representative organisation Conducting the OEF study of the representative organization is an iterative process. Based on the information gathered through the first consultation and the supporting studies, the Technical Secretariat shall carry out a second OEF-RO. This second OEF-RO shall include new EF compliant datasets, updated default activity data and all assumptions that are at the basis of the requirements in the second draft OEFSR. Based on the second OEF-RO, the Technical Secretariat shall draft a second OEF-RO report. The Technical Secretariat shall use EF compliant datasets if available for free. In case EF compliant datasets are not available, the following rules shall be followed in hierarchical order: 97Organization or business that has its own separate legal and financial existence\n\nL 471/516 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 \u2022 An EF compliant proxy is available for free: it shall be included in the list of default processes of the OEFSR and stated within the limitations Sectionof the second draft OEFSR. \u2022 An ILCD-EL compliant dataset as proxy is available for free: A", "embedding_index": 248}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_249", "text": " order: 97Organization or business that has its own separate legal and financial existence\n\nL 471/516 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 \u2022 An EF compliant proxy is available for free: it shall be included in the list of default processes of the OEFSR and stated within the limitations Sectionof the second draft OEFSR. \u2022 An ILCD-EL compliant dataset as proxy is available for free: A maximum of 10% of the single overall score may be derived from ILCD-EL compliant datasets. \u2022 If no EF compliant or ILCD-EL compliant dataset is available for free: it shall be excluded from the model. This shall be clearly stated in the second draft OEFSR as a data gap and validated by the OEFSR verifiers. The second OEF-ROshall determine all the requirements of the final OEFSR including, but not limited to, the final list of most-relevantimpact categories, life-cyclestages, processes, direct elementary flows, cut-offs, etc. A second OEF-RO report shall be provided (following the template in part E of this Annex)and shall include the characterised, normalised and weighted results. The second OEF-RO and its report shall be reviewed by the review panel and a public review report shall be provided as its annex. A.2.8 The second draft OEFSR The Technical Secretariat shall draft the second draft OEFSR taking into consideration the results of the supporting studies and of the second OEF-RO. All the Sections in the OEFSR template (see part E of this annex) shall be filled in. The OEFSR shall clarify that all the data gaps included in the OEFSR will remain data gaps for its entire validity. Therefore, data gaps are indirectly part of the system boundary of the OEFSR to allow a fair comparison among the organisations (if applicable) A.2.9. The OEFSR review A.2.9.1. Review panel The TS shall set up an external independent third-party review panel for the OEFSR review. The panel shall be composed of minimum three members (a chair and two members). In case a OEFSRentails more than five RO, the review panel could be enlarged with more members and additional co-chairs.The panel shall include one EF/LCA expert (with a background on sector under consideration and sector-related environmental aspects), one industry expert and, if possible, one representative from NGOs. One member shall be selected as the lead reviewer. The reviewers shall be independent from each other from a legal entity point of view. The panel shall not include representatives of the members98of the TS or other entities involved in the work of the TS, or employees of the companies running the supporting studies. Exceptions to this rule are to be discussed and agreed with the European Commission. A review team can change during the development of a OEFSR. Members can leave or join in between two reviews steps. However, it is the duty of the lead reviewerto ensure that the criteria for the review panel are fulfilled at each and every step of the OEFSR development process; the new members are updated by the lead reviewer about the previous steps and issues discussed. Lead reviewer can change as long as one of the others takes his/her role and ensures continuity of the work. The review process will include milestones, e.g. 1) 1stOEF-RO + 1stdraft OEFSR, 2) supporting studies + 2ndOEF- RO + 2nddraft OEFSR, 3) final draft OEFSR 4) final OEFSR. The continuity should be ensured within the same milestone. The previous requirement means that at least one member of the review team shall stay active in the 98 If an industry association is member of a Technical Secretariat, an industry expert of one company belonging to that industryassociation can be in the review panel. On the contrary, experts on the payroll of the association shall not be members of the review panel.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/517 project. If the requirements are not met, the review process shall start from the last milestone that fulfilled the requirements. The assessment of the competences of the review panel is based on a scoring system that takes into account their experience, EF/LCA methodology and practice, and knowledge of relevant technologies, processes or other activities included in the organisation(s) in scope of the OEFSR. Table 32 of this Annex presents the scoring system for each relevant competence and experience topic. The review panel members shall provide a self-declaration of their qualifications, stating how many points they achieved for each criterion and the total points achieved. This self-declaration shall be included in the OE", "embedding_index": 249}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_250", "text": " based on a scoring system that takes into account their experience, EF/LCA methodology and practice, and knowledge of relevant technologies, processes or other activities included in the organisation(s) in scope of the OEFSR.

The review panel members shall provide a self-declaration of their qualifications, stating how many points they achieved for each criterion and the total points achieved. This self-declaration shall be included in the OEFSR review report. The minimum necessary score to qualify as a reviewer is six points, including at least one point for each of the three mandatory criteria (i.e. review practice, EF/LCA methodology and practice, and knowledge of technologies or other activities relevant to the EF study). A.2.9.2 Review procedure The TS shall agree on the review procedure with the review panel when signing thereview contract. In particular, the TS shall agree the period available to the review panel for producing comments after each document is released by the TS and how to manage the comments received. The review panel will be responsible for the independent review of the following documents (see figure 1): \u2022 Any draft version of the OEFSR (first, second and final); \u2022 First and second OEF-RO, including the RO model, data and OEF-RO reports; \u2022 Supporting studies, including the related OEF model, data and OEF report; If the second consultation or the OEFSR review affects the results of the second OEF-RO, the second OEF-RO shall be updated and the results shall be implemented in the final draft OEFSR. In this case, the final draft OEFSR and final OEFSR shall be reviewedby the review panel. The panel shall send the review of each document to the TS for their analysis and discussion. The TS shall review the panel\u2019s comments and proposals, and it shall develop a response for each. For all documents, the TS shall generate written responses through review reports that may include: \u2022 Acceptance of the proposal: change the document to reflect proposal, \u2022 Acceptance of the proposal: change the document with modification to the original proposal, \u2022 Supporting comments on why the TS did not agree with the proposal, 1.

Review of the first OEF-RO The first OEF-RO and its related OEF-RO report shall be reviewed by the review panel, in accordance withthe verification procedure as presented in Section8.4 of the Annex III. However, on-site visits do not apply and if the RO is a virtual organisation, the reviewers shall agree with the technical secretariat on technique(s) to validate the activity data. If the OEFSR defines several ROs, the review shall check that all the ROs defined in the OEFSR are included in the scope of the different OEF-RO studies. In addition to the guidelines provided in Section8.4, the following review steps shall be made: 1. Assure that the instructions given in Sections A.2.4.,A.3.2.7., A.4.2, A.4.3., A.4.4.3, A.6.1. and 4.4.9.4 are followed; 2. Evaluate whether the methods used to make estimates are appropriate and applied consistently; 3. Identify uncertainties that are greater than expected and assess the effects of the identifieduncertainty on the final OEF results; 4. For intermediate products in the product portfolio validate if (i) the A value of the organisation in scope is set to 1 for the hotspot analysis and (ii) if this is documented in the OEFSR; 5. Check that the GHG emissions and removals are calculated and reported following the rules of Section A.4.2.9. 6. In case non EF compliant datasets are used to model the first OEF-RO, the steps related to checking the correct implementation in the software may be skipped A.2.9.2.2. Supporting study review The supporting studies and their OEF reports shall be reviewed by the review panel. At least three supporting studies per RO shall be reviewed by the review panel.

The OEFSR shall identify in the system diagram the organisational boundaries and the OEF boundaries. A.3.2.6. List of EF impact categories The OEFSR shall list the 16 EF impact categories to be used to calculate the OEF profile, as listed in Table 2 of the Annex III. Out of the 16 impact categories, the OEFSR shall list those that are most-relevantfor the sector or sub-sector(s) in scope (see SectionA.6.1.1of this Annex).

This assessment may be based on expert judgement, be LCA-based, or be derived through other means already put in place within the sector. The assessment shall be clearly explained in a dedicated Sectionof the first and second OEF-RO report.

While the Technical Secretariat may determine how biodiversity shall be assessed and reported in the OEFSR (if relevant), the following suggestions are available: 1. To express the (avoided) impact on biodiversity as the percentage of material that comes from ecosystems that have been managed to maintain or enhance conditions for biodiversity. This shall then be demonstrated by aregular monitoring and reporting of biodiversity levels, gains or losses (e.g. less than 15% loss of species richness due to disturbance, but the Technical Secretariat may set their own level provided this is well justified). The assessment should refer tomaterials that end up in the final products and to materials that have been used during the production process. For example, charcoal that is used in steel production processes, or soy that is used to feed cows that produce dairy etc. 2. To report additionally the percentage of such materials for which no chain of custody or traceability information can be found. 3. To use a certification system as a proxy. The Technical Secretariat shall determine which certification schemes provide sufficient evidence for ensuring biodiversity maintenance and describe the criteria used102. A.3.2.7.2. Additional technical information The OEFSR shall list the additional technical information that shall/ should/ may be reported. If the products belonging to the PP in scope are an intermediate product, the OEFSR shall request the following additional technical information: 1. The biogenic carbon content at factory gate (physical content) shall be reported in the OEF study. If derived from a native forest, the OEFSR shall require that the corresponding carbon emissions shall be modelled with the elementary flow \u2018(land use change)\u2019; 2. The recycled content (R1) shall be reported; 3. Results with application-specific A-values of the circular footprint formula, if relevant. A.3.2.8. Assumptions and limitations The OEFSR shall include the list of limitations an OEF study is subject to, even if carried out in accordance with the OEFSR. The technical secretariat shall specify under which conditions the OEFSR enables comparisons of organisations belonging to the same sector and/or sub-sector (e.g. through normalisation of the OEF profile against the yearly turnover of the organisation). The OEFSR shall list the ILCD-EL compliant datasets used when modelling the representative organisation(s) and the data gaps. A.4.LIFE-CYCLEINVENTORY A.4.1. Direct and indirect activities and life-cyclestages The OEFSR shall identify the processes expected to belong to direct activities and the ones expected to belong to indirect activities. If the PP includes mainly products, the OEFSR shall list all processes for each life-cyclestage. This step is optional if the PP includes mainly services, in this case it is up to the Technical Secretariat to evaluate the applicability of life-cyclestages to the sector in scope (see Section4.2 of Annex III, which describes the applicability of life-cycle stages to OEF studies). 102A useful overview of standards can be found on http://www.standardsmap.org/\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/525 The default life-cyclestages are listed in Section4.2 of Annex III and further detailed in Sections 4.2.1-4.2.5 of Annex III.

For each process, the OEFSR shall include the default secondary datasets that the user of the OEFSR shall apply, unless the process is covered by mandatory company-specific data. A.4.2. Modelling requirements A.4.2.1. Agricultural production For agricultural activities, the modelling guidelines of Section4.4.1of the Annex III shall be followed for the ROs and included in the OEFSRs. Any exception shall be agreed upon with the Commission before being implemented. A.4.2.1.1. Fertilisers For nitrogen-based fertilisers, the Tier 1 emissions factors of table 2-4 of IPCC (2006) should be used, as presented in Table 3 of the Annex III. The nitrogen field model presented in Table 3 of the Annex III has some limitations and should be improved in the future. Therefore, OEFSRs which have agricultural modelling in scope shall test (as minimum) the following alternative approach within the OEF-ROs. The N-balance is calculated using the parameters in Table II-3and the formula below. The total NO-N emission 3 to water is considered a variable and its total inventory shall be calculated as: \u2018Total NO-N emission to water\u2018 = \u2018NO-base loss\u2018 + \u2018additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018,with 3 3 3 \u2018Additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018 = \u2018N input with all fertilisers\u2018 + \u2018N fixation by crop\u2018 \u2013 \u2018N- 3 2 removal with the harvest\u2018\u2013\u2018NH emissions to air\u2018\u2013\u2018NO emissions to air\u2018\u2013\u2018N emissions to air\u2018-\u2018NO- 3 2 2 3 base loss\u2018. If in certain low-input schemes the value for \u2018additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018is negative, the value shallbe 3 set to \u20180\u2018.Moreover, in such cases the absolute value of the calculated \u2018additional NO-N emissions to water\u2018is to 3 be inventoried as additional N-fertiliser input into the system, using the same combination of N-fertilisers as employed to the analysed crop. This serves to avoid regarding fertility-depleting schemes by capturing the N- depletion by the analysed crop that is assumed to lead to the need for additional fertiliser later on to keep the same soil fertility level.

This shall be validated by the review panel of the OEFSR. As a second alternative, in case better data is available, a more comprehensive nitrogen field model may be used in the OEFSR, provided (i) it covers at least the emissions requested in Table 3 of the Annex III, (ii) N shall be balanced in inputs and outputs and (iii) it shall be described in a transparent way. A.4.2.2. Electricity use The requirements in Section4.4.2 of the Annex III shall be applied, unless the OEFSR covers electricity as main product (e.g., photovoltaic systems). A.4.2.2.1. Electricity modelling for representative organisations When modelling the RO the following electricity mix shall be used in hierarchical order: (i) Sector specific information on the use of green electricity shall be used if: (a) available, and (b) theset of minimum criteria to ensure the contractual instruments are reliable is met.This may be combined with the remaining electricity to be modelled with the residual grid mix. (ii) In case no sector specific information is available, the consumption grid mix shall be used. In case the RO is situated in different locations and/or the products in the PP are sold in different countries, the electricity mix shall reflect the ratios of production or ratios of sales between EU countries/regions. To determine the ratio, a physical unit shall be used (e.g. number of pieces or kg of product). Where such data are not available, the average EU mix (EU+EFTA), or region representative mix shall be used. A.4.2.3. Transport and logistics The OEFSR shall provide default transport scenarios to be used, in case these data are not listed as mandatory company-specific information (see SectionA.4.4.1) and supply-chain specific information is not available. The default transport scenarios shall reflect the European average transport, including all different transport options within the current product category (e.g. including home delivery, if applicable). In case no OEFSR-specific data103is available, the default scenarios and values outlined in Section4.4.3 of the Annex III shall be used. Replacement of the default values provided in Section 4.4.3 with OEFSR-specific values shall be clearly mentioned and justified in the OEFSR. The (final and intermediate) client of the products belonging to the PP shall be defined in the OEFSR104. The final client may be a consumer (i.e. any natural person who is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business, craft or profession) or a company that uses the product for final use, such as restaurants, professional painters, or a construction site. For the purposes of this Section, re-sellers and importers are intermediate clients and not final clients. 103 Product category specific data, defined by the TS and representing the European average for the products in scope. 104 A clear definition of the final client facilitates a correct inteprretation of the OEFSRby practitioners which will enhance the comparability of results.\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/527 A.4.2.3.1. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013truck transport The OEFSR shall specify the utilisation ratio to be used for each truck transport modelled, and it shall clearly indicate whether the utilisation ratio includes empty return trips. \u2022 If the load is mass-limited: a default utilisation ratio of 64%105shall be used. This utilisation ratio includes empty return trips. Therefore, empty returns shall not be modelled separately. The OEFSR shall list the truck dataset to be used, together with the utilisation factor to be used (64%). The OEFSR shall clearly indicate that the user shall check and adapt the utilisation ratio to the default value provided in the OEFSR. \u2022 If the load is volume-limited and the full volume is used: the OEFSR shall indicate the company-specific utilisation ratio calculated as the kg real load/kg payload of the dataset and indicate how empty returns shall be modelled. \u2022 If the load is delicate (e.g.", "embedding_index": 257}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_258", "text": ", together with the utilisation factor to be used (64%). The OEFSR shall clearly indicate that the user shall check and adapt the utilisation ratio to the default value provided in the OEFSR. \u2022 If the load is volume-limited and the full volume is used: the OEFSR shall indicate the company-specific utilisation ratio calculated as the kg real load/kg payload of the dataset and indicate how empty returns shall be modelled. \u2022 If the load is delicate (e.g. flowers): it is likely that the full truck volume cannot be used. The OEFSR shall evaluate the most appropriate utilisation ratio to be applied. \u2022 Bulk transport (e.g., gravel transport from mining pit to concrete plant) shall be modelled with a default utilisation ratio of 50% (100% loaded outbound and 0% loaded inbound). \u2022 Reusable products and packaging shall be modelled with OEFSR-specific utilisation ratios. The default value of 64% (including empty return) cannot be used because the return transport is modelled separately for reusable products. A.4.2.3.2. Allocation of impacts from transport \u2013consumer transport The OEFSR shall prescribe the default allocation value to be used for consumer transport, if applicable. A.4.2.3.3. Default scenarios \u2013from supplier to factory The OEFSR shall specify default transport distances, transport modes (specific dataset) and truck load factors to be used for the transport of products from supplier to factory. If no OEFSR specific data are available, then the default data provided in Section4.4.3.4of the Annex III shall be prescribed in the OEFSR. A.4.2.3.4. Default scenarios \u2013from factory to final client The transport from factory to final client (including consumer transport) shall be described in the distribution stage of the OEFSR. This helps fair comparisons between products delivered through traditional shops as well as delivered at home. In case no OEFSR-specific transport scenario is available, the default scenario outlinedin Section4.4.3.5of the Annex III shall be used as a basis, together with a number of OEFSR-specific values: 1. Ratio between products sold through retail, distribution centre (DC) and directly to the final client; 2. For factory to final client: Ratio between local, intracontinental and international supply chains; 3. For factory to retail: distribution between intracontinental and international supply chains. Forreusable products the return transport from retail/DC to factory shall be modelled in addition to the transport needed to go to retail/DC. The same transport distances as from product factory to final client shall be used (see Section4.4.3.5 of the Annex I), however the truck utilisation ratio might be volume-limited depending on the type of product. The OEFSR shall indicate the utilisation ratio that shall be used for the return transport. A.4.2.4. Capital goods \u2013infrastructure and equipment During the execution of the OEF-RO studies all processes shall be included in the modelling without applying any cut-off, the modelling assumptions and secondary datasets used shall be clearly documented. The OEFSR shall identify if, based on the results of the OEF-RO study, capital goods are subject to cut-off or not. If capital goods are included in the OEFSR, clear rules for their calculation shall be provided. 105 Eurostat 2015 indicates that 21% of the kms truck transport are driven with empty load and 79% are driven loaded (with an unknown load). In Germany only, the average truck load is 64%.\n\nL 471/528 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 A.4.2.5. Sampling procedure In some cases, a sampling procedure is needed by the user of an OEFSR to limit the data collection only to a representative sample of plants/ farms etc. Examples of cases whenthe sampling procedure may be needed are in case multiple production sites are involved in the production of the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU); e.g., in case the same raw material/ input material comes from multiple sites or in case the same process is outsourced to more than one subcontractor/ supplier. For OEFSRs a stratified sample shall be used, i.e. one that ensures that sub-populations (strata) of a given population are each adequately represented within the whole sample of a research study. With this type of sampling, it is guaranteed that subjects from each sub-population are included in the final sample, whereas simple random sampling does not ensure that sub-populations are represented equally or proportionately within the sample.

The Technical Secretariat shall decide if sampling is allowed or not allowed in its OEFSR. The Technical Secretariat may explicitly prohibit the use of sampling procedures in the OEFSR. In this case sampling will not be allowed in OEF studies and the user of the OEFSR shall collect data from all plants or farms. If the Technical Secretariat allows sampling, the OEFSR shall contain the following sentence: \u2018In case sampling is needed, it shall be conducted as specified in this OEFSR. However, sampling is not mandatory andany user of this OEFSR may decide to collect the data from all the plants or farms, without performing any sampling.\u2018 In case the OEFSR allows the use of sampling, the OEFSR shall define the requirements for reporting by the user of the OEFSR. The population and the selected sample used for the OEF study shall be clearly described in the OEF report (e.g., the % of the total production or % of number of sites, following the requirements stated in the OEFSR). A.4.2.5.1. How to define homogeneous sub-populations (stratification) The OEF method requires aspects to be taken into consideration in the identification of the sub-populations (see Section4.4.6.1of the Annex I): 1. Geographical distribution of sites; 2. Technologies/ farming practices involved; 3. Productioncapacity of the companies/ sites taken into consideration. The OEFSR may list additional aspects to be taken into consideration within a specific product category. In case additional aspects are taken into account, the number of sub-populations is calculated using the formula (equation 1) provided in Section4.4.6.1 of the Annex III and multiplying the result with the numbers of classes identified for each additional aspect (e.g., those sites which have an environmental management or reporting systems in place). A.4.2.5.2. How to define sub-sample size at sub-population level The OEFSR shall specify the approach chosen among the two available in Section4.4.6.2 of the Annex III. The same approach shall be used for all the sub-populations selected. In case the first approach is chosen the OEFSR shall establish the unit of measure for the production (e.g., t, m3, m2or valuein \u20ac).The OEFSR shall identify the percentage of production to be covered by each sub-population, which shall not be lower than 50%, expressed in the relevant unit.

Main function approach or delta approach The OEFSR shall describe which approach shall be applied (main function approach or delta approach, Section 4.4.7.1of the Annex III). In case the delta approach is used, the OEFSR shall specify a reference consumption to be defined for each associated product (e.g. of energy and materials). The reference consumption refers to the minimum consumption\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/529 that is essential for providing the function. The consumption above this reference (the delta) will then be allocated to the product. To define the reference situation, the following shall be considered, if available: 1. Regulations applicable to the product category; 2. Standards or harmonised standards; 3. Recommendations from manufacturers or manufacturers\u2019 organisations; 4. Use agreements established by consensus in sector-specific working groups. A.4.2.6.2. Modelling the use stage For all processes belonging to the use stage (both most-relevantand the others): 2.

Example: pasta This is a simplified example on how the environmental footprint of the use stage can be modelled and reported for the product \u20181 kg dry pasta\u2019 (adapted from the final OEFSR for dry pasta106). Table LL-6presents the processes used for modelling the use stage of 1kg dry pasta (boiling time according to instructions, for instance 10 minutes; amount of water, according to the instructions, for instance 10 litres). Among the four processes, electricity and heat use are the most-relevantones. Within this example, all four processes are product dependent. The amount of water use and cooking time is in general indicated on the packaging. The manufacturer can change the recipe in order to increase or reduce the cooking time, and therefore the energy use. Within the OEFSR, default data is provided on all four processes, as indicated in Table LL-6(activity data + LCI 106 Available at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/OEFSR_OEFSR_en.htm\n\nL 471/530 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 dataset to be used).

Incase the price of secondary materials is higher than that of the primary ones, the quality ratios shall be equal to 1. \u2022 If economic aspects are less relevant than physical aspects, the latter may be used. A.4.2.7.4. Recycled content (R1) The OEFSR shall provide the list of default R1 values, which shall be used by the user of the OEFSR in case no company-specific values are available. For this, the Technical Secretariat shall select the appropriate application- specific R1 values available in Part C of AnnexIV. In case no application-specific values are available, R1 shall be set equal to 0. Material-specific values based on supply market statistics shall not be used as a proxy. All possible geographic regions shall be provided. The applied R1 values shall be subject to the OEFSR review (if applicable) or OEF study verification (if applicable).

If the formula is applied in OEF studies for intermediate products (cradle-to-gate studies), the OEFSR shall prescribe: 1. The use of the CFF; 2. To exclude the EoLby setting the parameters R2, R3, and Ed to 0 for the products included in the PP; 3. Use A=1 for the intermediate products in the PP. When developing the OEFSR, the A value of the product in the PP shall be set to 1 for the hotspot analysis in the OEF-RO study to allow to focus the analysison the actual system.

Greenhouse gas emissions and removals To provide all necessary information for developing the OEFSR, the OEF-RO study shall always calculate the three climate change sub-categories separately. If climate change is identified as a most-relevant impact category, the OEFSR shall (i) request to report the total climate change as the sum of the three sub-categories, and (ii) request the reporting of the sub-categories \u2018climate change -fossil\u2019, \u2018climate change \u2013biogenic\u2019 and \u2018climate change -land use and land use change\u2019, separately if the OEF-RO study shows a contribution of more than 5%108each to the total score. A.4.2.9.1. Sub-category 2: Climate change \u2013biogenic The OEFSR shall specify if a simplified modelling approach shall be used when modelling the foreground emissions. In the case a simplified modelling approach is chosen, the OEFSR shall include the following text: \u2018Only the emission \u2018methane (biogenic)\u2019 is modelled, while no further biogenic emissions and uptakes from the atmosphere are included. When methane emissions can be both fossil or biogenic, the release of biogenic methane shall be modelled first and then the remaining fossil methane.\u2019 In the case a simplified modelling approach is not chosen, the OEFSR shall include the following text: \u2018All biogenic carbon emissions and removals shall be modelled separately. However, note that the corresponding characterisation factors for biogenic CO uptakes and emissions within the EF impact assessment method are set 2 to zero\u2018. 108 For example, if 'Climate change -biogenic' contributes with 7% (using absolute values) to the total climate change impact and 'Climate change \u2013land use and land use change' contributes with 3% to the total climate change impact. In that case, the total climate change impact and the 'Climate change \u2013biogenic' shall be reported.

Packaging European average packaging datasets shall be used in case the OEFSR does not request the use of company- specific data, no supplier-specific information is available or the packaging is not relevant. Although the default secondary datasets shall be listed in the OEFSR, for some multi-material packaging the OEFSR shall provide additional information to allow the user to perform a correct modelling. This is for example the case for beverage cartons and bag-in-box packaging: \u2022 Beverage cartons are made out of LDPE granulates and liquid packaging board, with or without aluminium foil. The amount of LDPE granulates, board and foil (also called the bill of material of beverage cartons) depends on the application of the beverage carton and shall be defined in the OEFSR if applicable (e.g. wine cartons, milk cartons).

Data collection requirements and quality requirements The materiality principle One of the main features of the OEF method is the \u2018materiality\u2018approach, i.e. focusing where it really matters. In the OEF context, the materiality approach is developed around two main areas: Impact categories, life-cyclestages, processes and direct elementary flows: the OEFSR shall identify the most- relevantones. These are the environmental contributions on which companies, stakeholders, consumers, and policy makers should focus (see Section7.3of the Annex III); Data requirements: as the most-relevantprocesses are those driving the environmental profile of an organisation, these shall be assessed by using data of higher quality compared to the less relevant processes, independently from where these processes happen within the OEF boundaries. Once the model(s) for the representative organisation(s) is developed, the Technical Secretariat shall address the following two questions with the OEF-RO studies: 1. Which are the processes for which company-specific information is mandatory? 2. Which are the processes that are driving the environmental profile of the organisation (most-relevant processes)? A.4.4.1. List of mandatory company-specific data The list of mandatory company-specific data refers to the activity data, direct elementary flows and (unit) processes for which company-specific data shall be collected. This list defines the minimum data requirements to be fulfilled by the users of the OEFSR. The purpose is to avoid that a user without access to the relevant company-specific data is able to perform an OEF study and communicate its results by only applying default data and datasets. The OEFSR shall define the list of mandatory company-specific data For the selection of the mandatory company-specific data, the Technical Secretariat shall consider its relevance within the EF profile, the level of effort needed to collect these data (especially for SMEs) and the overall quantity", "embedding_index": 265}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_266", "text": " by the users of the OEFSR. The purpose is to avoid that a user without access to the relevant company-specific data is able to perform an OEF study and communicate its results by only applying default data and datasets. The OEFSR shall define the list of mandatory company-specific data For the selection of the mandatory company-specific data, the Technical Secretariat shall consider its relevance within the EF profile, the level of effort needed to collect these data (especially for SMEs) and the overall quantity of data / time required to collect all mandatory company-specific data and existing legal requirements defined in EU law on measuring certain emissions. For instance, in case specific EU ETS monitoring rules exist for the sector to which the product in scope of the OEFSR belongs, the OEFSR should refer to EU ETS quantification requirements as set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 for the processes and GHGs covered therein. In case of carbon capture and storage (CC), the requirements of the Annex III prevail. This decision has, in particular,two consequences: (i) companies may perform an OEF study by only searching for these data and using default data for everything outside this list, while (ii) companies that don\u2019t have company- specific data for any of the listed data cannot calculate an OEFSR-compliant OEF profile for an organisation on the sector concerned. For each process for which company-specific data is mandatory the OEFSR shall provide the following information: 1. the list of the company-specific activity data to be declared by the user of the OEFSR together with the default secondary datasets to be used. The list of activity data shall be as specific as possible in terms of units of measure and any other characteristics that could help the user in implementing the OEFSR; 2. the list of direct (i.e. foreground) elementary flows to be measured by the user of the OEFSR. This is the list of most-relevantdirect emissions and resources. For each emission and resource, the OEFSR shall specify the frequency of measurements, the measurement methods and any other technical information necessary to ensure that OEF profiles are comparable.Note that the direct elementary flows listed shall be aligned with the nomenclature used by the most recent version of the EF reference package109. Considering that the data for these processes shall be company-specific, the score of P cannot be higher than 3, the score for TiR,TeR, and GeR cannot be higher than 2, and the DQR score shall be equal or lower than 1.5 (\u22641.5).

Datasets to be used When developing the final OEFSR, EF compliant datasets110shall be used. In case EF compliant datasets are not available, the following rules shall be followed in hierarchical order: 1. An EF compliant proxy is available for free: it shall be included in the list of default processes of the OEFSR and stated within the limitations Sectionof the OEFSR. 2. An ILCD-EL compliant dataset as proxy is available for free: A maximum of 10% of the single overall score may be derived from ILCD-EL compliant datasets. 3.

Cut-off Any cut-off shall be avoided in the first OEF-RO study and supporting studies. Based on the results of the first OEF-RO study and if confirmed by the supporting study results, the second OEF- RO study and OEFSR may exclude processes from the RO system boundaries by applying the following rule: (a) In case processes are excluded from the model, this shall be done based on a 3% cut-off considering their environmental impact for all impact categories, additionally to the cut-off already included in the background datasets. This rule is valid for both intermediate and final products. The processes that in total(cumulatively)account less than 3%of the environmental impact for each impact category may be excluded from the RO. In case the Technical Secretariat decides to apply the cut-off rule, second OEF- RO shall exclude the processes and the OEFSR shall list the processes that shall be excluded based on the cut-off. (b) In case the processes identified for cut-off from the first OEF-RO study are not confirmed by the supporting studies, the decision about their exclusion or inclusion shall be left to the review panel and reported explicitly in the review report to be annexed to the OEFSR. The OEFSR shall list the processes that shall be excluded from the modelling based on the cut-off rule and indicate that no additional cut-offs are allowed by the user of the OEFSR. In case the Technical Secretariat decides that no cut-off is allowed, this requirement shall be explicitly mentioned in the OEFSR. 110http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/contactListEF.xhtml) 111 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/ 112 http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/LCDN/developerEF.xhtml\n\nL 471/538 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 A.4.4.4. Data quality requirements A.4.4.4.1. The DQR formula The OEFSR shall provide tables with the criteria to be used for the semi-quantitative assessment of each data quality criteria. The OEFSR may specify more stringent or specify additional data quality requirements if appropriate for the sector in question. A.4.4.4.2. The DQR of company-specific datasets When creating a company-specific dataset, the data quality of i) the company-specific activity data and ii) the company-specific direct elementary flows (i.e. emission data) shall be assessed separately by the user of the OEFSR. To allow the evaluation of the DQR of data sets with company-specific data, the OEFSR shall include at least one table on how to assess the value of the DQR criteria for these processes. The table(s) to be included in the OEFSR shall be based on Table 23 of Annex III: only the reference years criteria (Ti , Ti ) may be R-EF R-AD adapted by the Technical Secretariat. The DQR of the sub-processes linked to the activity data (see Figure 9 of the Annex I) are evaluated through the requirements provided in the DNM(Section4.4.4.4of this Annex). The DQR of the newly developed dataset shall be calculated as follows: 1. Select the most-relevantactivity data and direct elementary flows: most-relevantactivity data are the ones linked to sub-processes (i.e. secondary datasets) that account for at least 80% of the total environmental impact of the company-specific dataset, listing them from the most contributing to the least contributing one.

Most-relevant direct elementary flows are defined as those direct elementary flows contributing cumulatively at least with 80% to the total impact of the direct elementary flows. 2. Calculate the DQR criteria TeR, TiR, GeR and P for each most-relevant activity data and each most- relevantdirect elementary flow. The values of each criteria shall be assigned based on the table on how to assess the value of the DQR criteria provided in the OEFSR. a. Each most-relevantdirect elementary flow consists of the amount and elementary flow naming (e.g. 40 g carbon dioxide). For each most-relevantelementary flow, the user of the OEFSR shall evaluate the 4 DQR criteria named TeR , TiR , GeR , OEF. Examples of elements tobe -EF -EF -EF evaluated include the timing of the flow measured, the technology for which the flow was measured and in which geographical area the measurement was made. b.

Considering that the data for the mandatory processes shall be company-specific, the score of P cannot be higher than 3 while the score for TiR, TeR, and GeR cannot be higher than 2 (The DQR score shall be \u22641.5). 3. Calculate the environmental contribution of each most-relevant activity data (through linking to the appropriate sub-process) and each most-relevant direct elementary flow to the total sum of the environmental impact of all most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows, in % (weighted, using all EF impact categories). For example, the newly developed dataset has only two most-relevant activity data, contributing in total to 80% of the total environmental impact of the dataset: a. Activity data 1 carries 30% of the total dataset environmental impact. The contribution of this process to the total of 80% is 37.5% (the latter is the weight to be used). b. Activity data 2 carries 50% of the total dataset environmental impact. The contribution of this process tothe total of 80% is 62.5% (the latter is the weight to be used). 4. Calculate the TeR, TiR, GeR and P criteria of the newly developed dataset as the weighted average of each criterion of the most-relevantactivity data and direct elementary flows. The weightis the relative contribution (in %) of each most-relevantactivity data and direct elementary flow calculated in step (3). 5. The user of the OEFSR shall calculate the total DQR of the newly developed dataset using Equation 20 of the Annex I, where are the weighted averages calculated as specified in point (4). \ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ufffd,\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ufffd,\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ufffd,\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ufffd\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/539 A.4.4.4.3.

Results of OEF studies are the basisfor the provision of EF information and they may be used in a diverse number of potential fields of applications, including in-house management and participation in voluntary or mandatory programmes. For all requirements not specified in this OEFSR the user of the OEFSR shall refer to the documents this OEFSR is in conformance with (see SectionB.7). The compliance with the present OEFSR is optional for OEF in-house applications, whilst it is mandatory whenever the results of an OEF study or any of its content is intended to be communicated. Terminology: shall, should and may This OEFSR uses precise terminology to indicate the requirements, the recommendations and options that could be chosen when an OEF study is conducted. The term \u201cshall\u201d is used to indicate what is required in order for an OEF study to be in conformance with this OEFSR.

The next Sections provide tables with the criteria to be used for the semi-quantitative assessment of each criterion. [The OEFSR may specify more stringent data quality requirements and specify additional criteria for the assessment of data quality. The OEFSR shall report the formulas to be used for assessing the DQR of i) company- specific data (equation 20 of Annex III), ii) secondary datasets (equation 19 of Annex III), iii) OEF study (equation 20 of Annex III).] B.5.3.1. Company-specific datasets The DQR shall be calculated at the level-1 disaggregation, before any aggregation of sub-processes or elementary flows is performed. The DQR of company-specific datasets shall be calculated as following: 1) Select the most-relevantactivity data and direct elementary flows: most-relevantactivity data are the ones linked to sub-processes (i.e. secondary datasets) that account for at least 80% of the total environmental impact of the company-specific dataset, listing them from the most contributing to the least contributing one. Most-relevant direct elementary flows are defined as those direct elementary flows contributing cumulatively at least with 80% to the total impact of the direct elementary flows. 2) Calculate the DQR criteria TeR, TiR, GeR and P for each most-relevant activity data and each most- relevantdirect elementary flow. The values of each criterion shall be assigned based on Table B.9. a. Each most-relevantdirect elementary flow consists of the amount and elementary flow naming (e.g. 40 g carbon dioxide). For each most-relevantelementary flow, the user of the OEFSR shall evaluate the 4 DQR criteria named TeR , TiR , GeR , P . For example, the user of the -EF -EF -EF EF OEFSR shall evaluate the timing of the flow measured, for which technology the flow was measured and in which geographical area. b. For each most-relevantactivity data, the 4 DQR criteria shall be evaluated (named TR TiR e -AD - , GeR , P )by the user of the OEFSR. AD -AD AD c. Considering that the data for the mandatory processes shall be company-specific, the score of P cannot be higher than 3, while the score for TiR, TeR, and GeRcannot be higher than 2 (The DQR score shall be \u22641.5). 3) Calculate the environmental contribution of each most-relevant activity data (through linking to the appropriate sub-process) and each most relevant direct elementary flow to the total sum of the environmental impact of all most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows, in % (weighted, using all EF impact categories). For example, the newly developed dataset has only two most-relevantactivity data, contributing in total to 80% of the total environmental impact of the dataset: a. Activity data 1 carries 30% of the total dataset environmental impact. The contribution of this process to the total of 80% is 37.5% (the latter is the weight to be used).\n\nL 471/558 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr 30.12.2021 b. Activity data 2 carries 50% of the total dataset environmental impact. The contribution of this process to the total of 80% is 62.5% (the latter is the weight to be used). 4) Calculate the TeR, TiR, GeR and P criteria of the newly developed dataset as the weighted average of each criteria of the most-relevant activity data and direct elementary flows. The weight is the relative contribution (in %) of each most-relevantactivity data and direct elementary flow calculated in step 3. 5) The user of the OEFSR shall calculate the total DQR of the newly developed dataset using Equation B.2, where are the weighted average calculated as specified in point (4). \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd,\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd,\ud835\udc4a\ufffd", "embedding_index": 280}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_281", "text": ".2, where are the weighted average calculated as specified in point (4). \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd,\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd,\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ufffd \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd , \ufffd \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 \ufffd [Equation B.2] \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ufffd+\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ufffd+\ufffd\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ufffd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ufffd+\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ufffd Table B. 9.

Note: for the use stage, the consumption grid mix shall be used. The environmental integrity of the use of supplier-specific electricity mix depends on ensuring that contractual instruments (for tracking) reliably and uniquely convey claims to consumers. Without this, the OEF lacks the accuracy and consistency necessary to drive product/ corporate electricity procurement decisions and accurate consumer (buyer of electricity) claims. Therefore, a set of minimum criteria that relate to the integrity of the contractual instruments as reliable conveyers of environmental footprint information has been identified. They represent the minimum features necessary to use supplier-specific mix within OEF studies. Set of minimum criteria to ensure contractual instruments from suppliers A supplier-specific electricity product/ mix may only be used if the user of the OEF method ensures that the contractual instrument meets the criteria specified below. If contractual instruments do not meet the criteria, then country-specific residual electricity consumption-mix shall be used in the modelling. The list of criteria below is based on the criteria of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance131\u2013. A contractual instrument used for electricity modelling shall: Criterion 1 \u2013Convey attributes 1. Convey the energy type mix associated with the unit of electricity produced. 2. The energy type mix shall be calculated based on delivered electricity, incorporating certificates sourced and retired (obtained or acquired or withdrawn) on behalf of its customers. Electricity from facilities for which the attributes have been sold off (via contracts or certificates) shall be characterized as having the environmental attributes of the country residual consumption mix where the facility is located. Criterion 2 \u2013Be a unique claim 1. Be the only instrument that carries the environmental attribute claim associated with that quantity of electricity generated. 2. Be tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled by or on behalf of the company (e.g. by an audit of contracts, third party certification, or may behandled automatically through other disclosure registries, systems, or mechanisms).

Activity data related to non-EU country consumption mix per detailed energy type shall be determined based on: 2. Domestic production mix per production technologies; 3. Import quantity and from which neighbouring countries; 4. Transmission losses; 5. Distribution losses; 6. Type of fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and / or domestic supply). These data may be found in the publications of the International Energy Agency (IEA (www.iea.org). 1. Available LCI datasets per fuel technologies. The LCI datasets available are generally specific to a country or a region in terms of: 2. fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and/ or domestic supply); 3. energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy contents); 4. technology standards of power plants regarding efficiency, firing technology, flue-gas desulphurisation, NOx removal and de-dusting.

Allocation rules for electricity Process Physicalrelationship Modelling instructions Process A Mass Process B N of pieces \u2026 \u2026 If the consumed electricity comes from more than one electricity mix, each mix source shall be used in terms of its proportion in the total kWh consumed. For example, if a fraction of this total kWh consumed is coming from a specific supplier a supplier-specific electricity mix shall be used for this part. See below for on-site electricity use. A specific electricity type may be allocated to one specific product in the following conditions: (a) If the production (and related electricity consumption) of a product occurs in a separate site (building), the energy type physical related to this separated site may be used. (b) If the production (and related electricity consumption) ofa product occurs in a shared space with specific energy metering or purchase records or electricity bills, the product-specific information (measure, record, bill) may be used. (c) If all the products produced in the specific plant are supplied with a publically available OEF study, the company wanting to make the claim shall make all OEF studies available. The allocation rule applied shall be described in the OEF study, consistently applied in all OEF studies connected to the site and verified. An example is the 100% allocation of a greener electricity mix to a specific product.

Contractual instruments have been sold to a third party: the \u2018country-specific residual grid mix, consumption mix\u2019 (combined with LCI datasets) shall be used. If electricity is produced in excess of the amount consumed on-site within the defined system boundary and is sold to, for example, the electricity grid, this system may be seen as a multifunctional situation. The system will provide two functions (e.g. product + electricity) and the following rules shall be followed: 1. If possible, apply subdivision. Subdivision applies both to separate electricity productions or to a common electricity production where you may allocate based on electricity amounts the upstream and direct emissions to your own consumption and to the share you sell out of your company (e.g. if a company has a windmill on its production site and exports 30% of the produced electricity, emissions related to 70% of produced electricity should be accounted in the OEF study). 2. If not possible, direct substitution shall be used. The country-specific residual consumption electricity mix shall be used as substitution132. Subdivision is considered as not possible when upstream impacts or direct emissions are closely related to the product itself. B.5.9. Climate change modelling The impact category \u2018climate change\u2019 shall be modelled considering three sub-categories: 1. Climate change \u2013fossil:This sub-category includes emissions from peat and calcination/carbonation of limestone. The emission flows ending with \u2018(fossil)\u2019 (e.g., \u2018carbon dioxide (fossil)\u2019 and \u2018methane (fossil)\u2019) shall be used, if available. 2. Climate change \u2013 biogenic: This sub-category covers carbon emissions to air (CO2, CO and CH4) originating from the oxidation and/or reduction of biomass by means of its transformation or degradation (e.g. combustion, digestion, composting, landfilling) and CO uptake from the atmosphere 2 through photosynthesis during biomass growth \u2013i.e. corresponding to the carbon content of products, biofuels or aboveground plant residues, such as litter and dead wood.

This sub-category includes biogenic carbon exchanges from deforestation, road construction orother soil activities (including soil carbon emissions). For native forests, all related CO emissions 2 are included and modelled under this sub-category (including connected soil emissions, products derived from native forest134 and residues), while their CO uptake is excluded. The emission flows 2 ending with \u2018(land use change)\u2019 shall be used. For land use change, all carbon emissions and removals shall be modelled following the modelling guidelines of PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011) and the supplementary document PAS2050-1:2012 (BSI 2012) for horticultural products. PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011): \u2018Large emissions of GHGs can result as a consequence of land use change. Removals as a direct result of land use change (and not as a result of long-term management practices) do not usually occur, although it is recognized that this could happen in specific circumstances. Examples of direct land use change are the conversion of land used for growing crops to industrial use or conversion from forestland to cropland. All forms ofland use change that result in emissions or removals are to be included. Indirect land use change refers to such conversions of land use as a consequence of changes in land use elsewhere. While GHG emissions also arise from indirect land use change, the methods and data requirements for calculating these emissions are not fully developed. Therefore, the assessment of emissions arising from indirect land use change is not included. The GHG emissions and removals arising from direct land use change shall be assessed for any input to the life-cycleof a product originating from that land and shall be included in the assessment of GHG emissions. The emissions arising from the product shall be assessed on the basis of the default land use change values provided in PAS 2050:2011 Annex C, unless better data is available. For countries and land use changes not included in this annex, the emissions arising from the product shall be assessed using the included GHG emissions and removals occurring as a result of direct land use change in accordance with the relevant Sections of the IPCC (2006). The assessment of the impact of land use change shall include all direct land use change occurring not more than 20 years, or a single harvest period, prior to undertaking the assessment (whichever is the longer). The total GHG emissions and removals arising from direct land use change over the period shall be included in the quantification of GHG emissions of products arising from this land on the basis of equal allocation to each year of the period135. 1. Where it can be demonstrated that the land use change occurred more than 20 years prior to the assessment being carried out, no emissions from land use change should be included in the assessment. 2.

Use of crop type specific and country-, region-or climate-specific data for yield, water and land use, land use change, fertiliser (artificial and organic) amount (N, P amount) and pesticide amount (per active ingredient), per hectare per year, if available. Cultivation data shall be collected over a period of time sufficient to provide an average assessment of the life- cycleinventory associated with the inputs and outputs of cultivation that will offset fluctuations due to seasonal differences: 1. For annual crops, an assessment period of at least three years shall be used (to level out differences in crop yields related to fluctuations in growing conditions over the years such as climate, pests and diseases, etc.). Where data covering a three-year period is not available i.e. due to starting up a new production system (e.g. new greenhouse, newly cleared land, shift to another crop), the assessment may be conducted over a shorter period, but shall be not less than 1 year. Crops/plants grown in greenhouses shall be considered as annual crops/plants, unless the cultivation cycle is significantly shorter than a year and another crop is cultivated consecutively within that year. Tomatoes, peppers and other crops which are cultivated and harvested over a longer period through the year are considered as annual crops. 2. For perennial plants (including entire plants and edible portions of perennial plants) a steady state situation (i.e. where all development stages are proportionally represented in the studied time period) shall be assumed and a three-year period shall be used to estimate the inputs and outputs136. 3. Where the different stages in the cultivation cycle are known to be disproportional, a correction shall be made by adjusting the crop areas allocated to different development stages in proportion to the crop areas expected in a theoretical steady state. The application of such correction shall be justified and recorded. The life-cycleinventory of perennial plants and cropsshall not be undertaken until the production system actually yields output. 4. For crops that are grown and harvested in less than one year (e.g. lettuce produced in 2 to 4 months) data shall be gathered in relation to the specific time period for productionof a single crop, from at least three recent consecutive cycles. Averaging over three years may best be done by first gathering annual data and calculating the life-cycleinventory per year and then determining the three years average. Pesticide emissionsshall be modelled as specific active ingredients. As a default approach, pesticides applied on the field shall be modelled as 90% emitted to the agricultural soil compartment, 9% emitted to air and 1% emitted to water.

Heavy metal emissions from field inputs shall be modelled as emission to soil and/or leaching or erosion to water. The inventory to water shall specify the oxidation state of the metal (e.g., Cr+3, Cr+6). As crops assimilate part of the heavy metal emissions during their cultivation, clarification is needed on how to model crops that act as a sink. The following modelling approach shall be used: [The TS shall select one of the two modelling approaches to be used] 1. The final fate of the heavy metals elementary flows are not further considered within the system boundary: the inventory does not account for the final emissions of the heavy metals and therefore shall not account for the uptake of heavy metals by the crop. For example, heavy metals in agricultural crops cultivated for human consumption end up in the plant. Within the EF context human consumption is not modelled, the final fate is not further modelled and the plant acts as a heavy metal sink.

The verifier(s) shall verify that the OEF study is conducted in compliance with this OEFSR. In case policies implementing the OEF method define specific requirements regarding verification and validation of OEF studies, reports and communication vehicles, the requirements in said policies shall prevail. 137 E.g. the EPBP design guidelines (http://www.epbp.org/design-methodlines), or Recyclability by design (http://www.recoup.org/)\n\n30.12.2021 EN Official JourialJfl thl ouJohirl rcJr L 471/577 The verifier(s) shall validate the accuracy and reliability of the quantitative information used in the calculation of the study. As this can be highly resource intensive, the following requirements shall be followed: 1. the verifier(s) shall check if the correct version of all impact assessment methods was used. For each of the most-relevantEF impact categories (ICs), at least 50% of the characterisation factors shall be verified, while all normalisation and weighting factors of all ICs shall be verified. In particular, the verifier(s) shall check that the characterisation factors correspond to those included in the EF impact assessment method the study declares compliance with138. This may also be done indirectly, for example: a. Export the EF-compliant datasets from the LCA software used to do the OEF study and run them in Look@LCI139 to obtain LCIA results. If Look@LCI results are within a deviation of 1% from the results in the LCA software, the verifier(s) may assume that the implementation of the characterisation factors in the software used to do the OEF study was correct. b. Compare the LCIA results of the most-relevantprocesses calculated with the software used to do the OEF study with the ones available in the metadata of the original dataset. If the compared results are within a deviation of 1%, the verifier(s) may assume that the implementation of the characterisation factors in the software used to do the OEF study was correct 2. cut-off applied (if any) fulfils the requirements at Section4.6.4 of Annex III. 3. all datasets used shall be checked against the data requirements (Sections 4.6.3 and 4.6.5. of Annex III). 4. For at least 80% (in number) of the most-relevantprocesses (as defined in Section6.3.3 of Annex III), the verifier(s) shall validate all related activity data and the datasets used to model these processes. If relevant, CFF parameters and datasets used to model them shall also be validated in the same way. The verifier(s) shall check that the most-relevant processes are identified as specified in Section 6.3.3 of Annex III; 5. For at least 30% (in number) of all other processes (corresponding to 20% of the processes as defined in Section6.3.3 of Annex III) the verifier(s) shall validate all related activity data and the datasets used to model these processes. If relevant, CFF parameters and datasets used to model them shall also be validated in the same way; 6. The verifier(s) shall check that the datasets are correctly implemented in the software (i.e. LCIA results of the dataset in the software are within a deviation of 1% to theones in the metadata). At least 50% (in number) of the datasets used to model most-relevantprocesses and 10% of those used to model other processes shall be checked. In particular, verifier(s) shall verify if the DQR of the process satisfies the minimum DQR as specified in the DNM for the selected processes. These data checks shall include, but should not be limited to, the activity data used, the selection of secondary sub-processes, the selection of the direct elementary flows and the CFF parameters. For example, if there are 5 processes and each one of them includes 5 activity data, 5 secondary datasets and 10 CFF parameters, then the verifier(s) has to check at least 4 out of 5 processes (70%) and, for each process, (s)he shall check at least 4 activity data (70% of the total amount of activity data", "embedding_index": 298}, {"chunk_id": "626f11c7-758b-47a9-9c48-461e466129c6_299", "text": " the selection of secondary sub-processes, the selection of the direct elementary flows and the CFF parameters.
