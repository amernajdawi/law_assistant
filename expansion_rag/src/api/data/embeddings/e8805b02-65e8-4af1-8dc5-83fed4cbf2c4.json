(2) On 11 December 2019, the Commission adopted its Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \u2018The European Green Deal\u2019(3). The European Green Deal represents a new growth strategy that aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. The implementation of the European Green Deal requires that investors are offered clear, long-term signals to avoid stranded assets and to raise sustainable finance. (3) Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 establishes EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. The methodology of those benchmarks is based on the commitments laid down in the Paris Agreement. It is necessary to specify the minimum standards applicable to both types of benchmarks. EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks pursue similar objectives but vary in their level of ambition. Most of the minimum standards should therefore be common to both types of benchmarks, but the thresholds should vary depending on the type of benchmark. (4) There are currently not enough data to assess the carbon footprint resulting from decisions made by sovereign entities. Sovereign-based issuances should therefore not be eligible constituents of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. (5) Because the methodology of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks is based on the commitments laid down in the Paris Agreement, it is necessary to use the 1,5 \u00b0C scenario, with no or limited overshoot, referred to in the Special Report on Global Warming of 1,5 \u00b0C from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)(4) (\u2018IPCC scenario\u2019). That IPCC scenario is in line with the Commission\u2019s objective to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, set out in the European Green Deal. To be in line with the IPCC scenario, investments should be reallocated from fossil-fuels dependent activities to green or renewable activities and the climate impact of those investments should improve year after year.

(2) Council Decision (EU) 2016/1841 of 5 October 2016 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (OJ L 282, 19.10.2016, p. 1).

To ensure that EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks provide a realistic image of the real economy, including of sectors that should actively reduce GHG emissions to make the objectives of the Paris Agreement attainable, the exposure of those benchmarks to those sectors should not be less than the exposure of their underlying investable universe. That requirement should, however, only apply to EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks that are equity benchmarks, to ensure that equity investors who support the objectives of the Paris Agreement maintain their influence, via engagement and voting, on the transition of the company towards more sustainable activities. (7) The calculation of GHG emissions should be comparable and consistent. It is therefore necessary to lay down rules about how often those calculations should be updated and, where applicable, about the currency to be used. (8) A decarbonisation based only on Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions could lead to counterintuitive results. It should therefore be clarified that the minimum standards for EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris- aligned Benchmarks should not only consider direct emissions from companies, but also emissions assessed on a life-cycle basis and thus including Scope 3 GHG emissions. However, due to the insufficient quality of data currently available for Scope 3 GHG emissions, it is necessary to set out an appropriate phase-in timeline and to allow for the use of fossil fuel reserves for a limited period of time. That phase-in timeline should be based on the list of economic activities set out in Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. (9) Benchmark administrators should have the possibility to overweight companies based on the decarbonisation objectives set by those companies. Specific rules relating to decarbonisation targets reported by individual companies should therefore be set out. (10) EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks should demonstrate their ability to decarbonize themselves from one year to the other. That minimum decarbonisation trajectory should be calculated using the IPCC scenario. Furthermore, in order to prevent greenwashing, conditions for the deviation from the decarbonisation trajectory and for the right to continue to label a benchmark as an EU Climate Transition Benchmark or as an EU Paris-aligned Benchmark should be specified. (11) The main parameter to calculate the decarbonisation trajectory should be the GHG intensity, because that parameter ensures comparability across sectors and is not biased for or against a particular sector. To calculate the GHG intensity, the market capitalisation of the concerned company is necessary. However, where benchmarks apply to fixed-income corporate instruments, the market capitalisation might not be available for companies that do not have equity securities listed. It should therefore be laid down that where EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks apply to fixed-income corporate instruments, benchmark administrators should be allowed to use GHG emissions calculated on an absolute basis, rather than on the basis of GHG intensity. (12) To ensure comparability and consistency of GHG emission data, rules on how to calculate changes in GHG intensity or absolute GHG emissions should be laid down. (13) Attaining the objectives of the Paris Agreement requires that both EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris- aligned Benchmarks have a baseline percentage reduction in exposure to GHG intensive assets compared to their parent benchmarks or underlying investment universes. However, that percentage reduction should be more significant for EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, which, by design, are more ambitious than EU Climate Transition Benchmarks.

It is therefore necessary to lay down specific exclusion criteria that are based on climate-related or other environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations. EU Climate Transition benchmarks should comply with those exclusion criteria by 31 December 2022, in accordance with the timeline set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. (15) In order to support a decrease in the use of polluting energy sources and a proper transition to renewable ones, it is also appropriate that companies that derive more than a set percentage of their revenues from coal, oil or gas are excluded from the EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. The changes in the share of those energy sources out of the global primary energy supply from 2020 to 2050, as expected in the IPCC scenario, should be taken into account to set out those specific exclusions. In particular, according to table 2.6 of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1,5 \u00b0C from the IPCC, between 2020 and 2050, the use of coal is expected to drop between 57 % and 99 % and the use of oil between 9 % and 93 %, while the use of gas is expected to go up by 85 % or to drop by 88 %. Gas can be used during the transition to a low carbon economy, in particular as a replacement for coal, which explains its wider expected range of evolution, although the expected median decrease of its use is 40 %. For the same reason, it is necessary to exclude companies that derive more than a set percentage of their revenues from electricity generation activities. (16) To ensure transparency about the methodology used for the EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, it is appropriate to lay down rules about the necessary disclosures pertaining to the decarbonisation trajectory and the data sources for both categories of benchmarks. For the same reason, it is appropriate to lay down disclosure requirements for benchmark administrators that use estimations for GHG emissions data, whether or not provided by external data providers. (17) In order to support the harmonisation of the methodology for EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris- aligned Benchmarks, it is appropriate to lay down rules about the quality and accuracy of data sources, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I DEFINITIONS Article 1 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply: (a) \u2018greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\u2019 means greenhouse gas emissions as defined in Article 3, point (1), of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6); (b) \u2018absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\u2019 means tonnes of CO equivalent, as defined in Article 2, point (7), of 2 Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7); (c) \u2018greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity\u2019 means absolute GHG emissions divided by millions of euros in enterprise value including cash; (6) Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 (OJ L 156, 19.6.2018, p. 26).

Article 5 Phase-in of Scope 3 GHG emissions data in the benchmark methodology 1. The benchmark methodology for EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks shall include Scope 3 GHG emissions data in the following way: (a) As of 23 December 2020, Scope 3 GHG emissions data for at least the energy and mining sectors referred to in Divisions 05 to 09 and 19 and 20 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006; (b) within two years from 23 December 2020, Scope 3 GHG emissions data for at least the transportation, construction, buildings, materials and industrial sectors referred to in Divisions 10 to 18, 21 to 33, 41, 42 and 43, 49 to 53 and Division 81 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006;\n\n3.12.2020 E N O f f i c i a l J o u r n a l o f t h e E u r o p e a n Union L 406/21 (c) within four years from 23 December 2020, Scope 3 GHG emissions data for all other sectors referred to in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. 2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, point (a), from 23 December 2020 to 31 December 2021, administrators of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and administrators of EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks may use fossil fuel reserves, where they demonstrate that they cannot calculate nor estimate Scope 3 GHG emissions data. Article 6 Companies setting and publishing GHG emission reduction targets Administrators of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and administrators of EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks may increase in those benchmarks the weight of the issuers of the constituent securities that set and publish GHG emission reduction targets, where the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the issuers of the constituent securities publish consistently and accurately their Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions; (b) the issuers of the constituent securities have reduced their GHG intensity or, where applicable, their absolute GHG emissions, including Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, by an average of at least 7 % per annum for at least three consecutive years.

Benchmark administrators may relabel a benchmark as an EU Climate Transition Benchmark or as an EU Paris- aligned Benchmark where that benchmark meets the decarbonisation trajectory target for two consecutive years following the loss of the label, unless that benchmark lost that label twice. Article 8 Change in GHG intensity and absolute GHG emissions 1. The change in GHG intensity or absolute GHG emissions shall be calculated as the percentage change between, on the one hand, the weighted average GHG intensity or absolute GHG emissions of all constituents of the EU Climate Transition Benchmark or the EU Paris-aligned Benchmark at the end of year \u2018n\u2019 and, on the other hand, the weighted average GHG intensity or absolute GHG emissions of all constituents of the benchmarks at the end of year n-1. 2. Benchmark administrators shall use a new base year whenever significant changes in the calculation methodology of GHG intensity or absolute GHG emissions occur. For the purposes of the first subparagraph, a new base year shall mean the year against which the decarbonisation trajectory referred to in Article 7 is calculated. The selection of a new base year shall be without prejudice to the rules laid down in Article 7(5).
