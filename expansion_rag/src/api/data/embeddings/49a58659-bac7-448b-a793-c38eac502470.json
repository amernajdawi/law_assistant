Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 was amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876(3), inter alia to introduce a new Article 449a. That Article requires large institutions that have issued securities that are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State to disclose, as from 28 June 2022, information on environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, including physical risks and transition risks. That amendment to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be reflected in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/637, which should set out, in addition to the existing uniform disclosure formats and associated instructions, additional uniform disclosure formats and associated instructions for the disclosures of ESG risks. (2) When laying down uniform disclosure formats, the complete materiality of the information to be disclosed should be taken into account. That means that disclosures by institutions should cover, on the one hand, the financial impact of ESG factors on the institutions\u2019 economic and financial activities (outside-in perspective), and, on the other hand, the ESG factors that may be triggered by the institutions\u2019 own activities, which in turn become financially material when they affect institutions\u2019 stakeholders (inside-out perspective). As a result, the tables and templates used for those disclosures should convey sufficiently comprehensive and comparable information on ESG risks, thus enabling users of that information to assess the risk profile of institutions. (1) OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1. (2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/637 of 15 March 2021 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to public disclosures by institutions of the information referred to in Titles II and III of Part Eight of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1423/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/1555, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/200 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/2295 (OJ L 136, 21.4.2021, p. 1). (3) Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities, counterparty credit risk, market risk, exposures to central counterparties, exposures to collective investment undertakings, large exposures, reporting and disclosure requirements, and Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 150, 7.6.2019, p. 1).\n\nL 324/2 EN Official Journal of the European Union 19.12.2022 (3) It is necessary to ensure coherence and consistency with other Union legislation in the area of ESG risks. Rules on the disclosure of ESG risks should therefore take into account the criteria, classifications and definitions laid down in that Union legislation. Those rules should in particular take into account the criteria for the identification and classification of environmentally sustainable economic activities, as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4) and in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818(5). With regard to the disclosure of information on the energy performance of the real estate portfolio of institutions, the information provided by the energy performance certificate as defined in Article 2, point 12, of Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), should be taken into account. (4) Articles 19a and", "embedding_index": 0}, {"chunk_id": "49a58659-bac7-448b-a793-c38eac502470_1", "text": " European Parliament and of the Council(4) and in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818(5). With regard to the disclosure of information on the energy performance of the real estate portfolio of institutions, the information provided by the energy performance certificate as defined in Article 2, point 12, of Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), should be taken into account. (4) Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council(7)require certain large undertakings that are public-interest entities, or public-interest entities which are parent undertakings of a large group, respectively, to include in their management report or in their consolidated management report information about the impact of their activity on environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti- corruption and bribery matters. That obligation does not apply, however, to other undertakings. As a result, undertakings that are not subject to Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU are not required to disclose such information and may be not able to provide such information to institutions. Those undertakings that are counterparties to institutions can thus only be expected to provide that information and data on a voluntary basis. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to provide those undertakings with guidance on the calculation of the percentage of the exposures to activities that are environmentally sustainable economic activities as referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, so that that information and those data can be presented in a standardised and comparable format. Where that information and those data are not provided voluntarily, institutions should be able to calculate the percentage of taxonomy-aligned exposures by using estimates or proxies. (5) Article 449a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 requires that the information on ESG risks is disclosed as of 28 June 2022, on an annual basis for the first year and biannually thereafter. For those reasons, the first annual disclosure reference date should be set as of 31 December 2022. (6) This Regulation is based on the draft implementing technical standards submitted to the Commission by the European Banking Authority. (7) The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the advice of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council(8). (8) Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/637 should therefore be amended accordingly, (4) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13).

Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ((16)*) and Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ((17)*) promote policies that aim to achieve a highly energy efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050. Directive 2010/31/EU introduced the Energy performance certificates (EPC) as instruments for improving the energy performance of buildings. Those certificates are referred to as a certificate recognised by a Member State or by a legal person designated by it, which indicates the energy performance of a building or building unit, calculated in accordance with that Directive. 3. This template shows the gross carrying amount, as referred to in Part 1 of Annex V to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451, of loans collateralised with commercial and residential immovable property and of repossessed real estate collaterals, including information on the level of energy efficiency of the collaterals measured in terms of kWh/m2 energy consumption (columns (b) to (g) of the template), in terms of the label of the energy performance certificate (EPC) of the collateral as referred to in Article 2, point (12), of Directive 2010/31/EU for Member States, or as defined in any relevant local regulation for those exposures outside the Union, where a mapping to the Union EPC label exists (columns (h) to (n)). 4. In particular, in columns (b) to (g), institutions shall disclose the gross carrying amount of exposures by energy efficiency buckets based on the specific energy consumption of the collateral in kWh/m2, as indicated in the EPC label of the collateral or estimated by institutions in the absence of the EPC label. Institutions shall indicate in rows 5 and 10 of the template the extent to which those data are estimated and not based on EPC labels.

In particular, in columns (b) to (g), institutions shall disclose the gross carrying amount of exposures by energy efficiency buckets based on the specific energy consumption of the collateral in kWh/m2, as indicated in the EPC label of the collateral or estimated by institutions in the absence of the EPC label. Institutions shall indicate in rows 5 and 10 of the template the extent to which those data are estimated and not based on EPC labels. In columns (h) to (n), institutions shall disclose the gross carrying amount of exposures grouped by the EPC label of the collateral for those collaterals where the EPC is available to the institution. 5. When disclosing the EPC distribution of the collaterals, institutions shall disclose separately, in column (o), those exposures for which they do not have the EPC information of the collateral. Where institutions do not have the EPC information, but are using internal calculations to estimate the energy efficiency of the collateral, institutions are to disclose the percentage of the exposures without EPC label of the collateral for which they are providing estimates (the percentage is to be computed based on the gross carrying amount of the exposures). Institutions shall disclose the total gross carrying amounts by energy consumption level and by EPC label, with a breakdown by location (Union vs non- Union area) differentiating between loans collateralised by commercial immovable property, loans collateralised by residential immovable property and collateral obtained by taking possession. 6. In the case of exposures to entities located in third countries where there is no EPC label equivalent, institutions shall leave columns (h) to (n) blank. However, institutions shall disclose the information required in columns (o) and (p) and, when relevant, columns (b) to (g) with estimated data. 7. For those exposures linked to more than one collateral, such as two immovable properties, the energy efficiency information of the properties linked to the exposure shall be split and disclosed separately under energy efficiency levels (both for the KWh/m2 of the collateral, columns (b) to (g), and for the EPC label, columns (h) to (n) corresponding to energy efficiency of each collateral). More specifically, institutions shall calculate the share of each collateral in the gross carrying amount of exposure based on the value of the collateral and disclose under the energy efficiency bucket linked to each collateral. For example, the institution has a loan with a gross carrying amount of EUR 100 000 collateralised by two properties: property A and property B. Property A has a collateral value of EUR 80 000and EPC label A, while property B has a collateral value of EUR 70 000and EPC label D. In this example, institutions should disclose EUR 53 333 (that is EUR 100 000 * [80 000/(80 000 + 70 000)] under EPC label A and EUR 46 667(that is EUR 100 000* [70 000/(80 000+ 70 000)] under EPC label D, both corresponding to the specific loan in question.
