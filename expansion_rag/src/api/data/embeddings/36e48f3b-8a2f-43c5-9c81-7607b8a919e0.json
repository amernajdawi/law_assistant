The term \u201cshall\u201d is used in this Guidance to indicate what is required for a GHG inventory to conform to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The term \u201cshould\u201d is used to indicate a recommendation, but not a requirement. The term \u201cmay\u201d is used to indicate an option that is permissible or allowable. This publication contains requirements and guidance from the Corporate Standard, and additional, sector-specific recommendations. Part 1: GENERAL INFORMATION 4\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Chapter 1: Introduction Agriculture is a major contributor to global emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) that drive climate change. Leadership and innovation from the sector is therefore vital in making progress in reducing these emissions and in abating the worst effects of climate change on agricultural production. Action in this arena also makes good business sense. By addressing GHG emissions, companies (and producers1) can identify opportunities to bolster their bottom line, reduce risk, and discover competitive advantages. A GHG emissions inventory is the foundational tool that allows a company to understand its GHG emissions and build effective climate change strategies. GHG inventories help companies understand their exposure to GHG-related risks, identify emissions reduction opportunities, create baseline data and reduction targets for tracking performance, and communicate performance to key audiences, including internal management and external stakeholders. Realizing these benefits requires that inventories are prepared according to industry-accepted best practices. This chapter: \uf0d8 Introduces the family of GHG Protocol publications that define best practices for developing GHG emissions inventories. \uf0d8 Describes how and why the Agricultural Guidance (\u2018Guidance\u2019) was developed, and for whom. \uf0d8", "embedding_index": 0}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_1", "text": " emissions reduction opportunities, create baseline data and reduction targets for tracking performance, and communicate performance to key audiences, including internal management and external stakeholders.

This chapter: \uf0d8 Introduces the family of GHG Protocol publications that define best practices for developing GHG emissions inventories. \uf0d8 Describes how and why the Agricultural Guidance (\u2018Guidance\u2019) was developed, and for whom. \uf0d8 Describes what guidance is (and is not) provided in this publication. \uf0d8 Summarizes how the Guidance differs from the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, and relates to other GHG Protocol publications. 1.1 Agriculture and climate change The international community has adopted a goal to restrict global warming to 2oC above pre-industrial levels2. Temperature rise above 2oC will produce increasingly unpredictable and dangerous impacts for people and ecosystems, but particularly for agricultural systems. Impacts on the agricultural sector that are already occurring but expected to intensify include increased irrigation water needs, increased spread of animal and crop diseases and pests, reduced forage quality, and reduced crop and pasture yields (Easterling et al., 2007). These impacts stem from changes in surface temperatures, the timing of seasons, and in the frequency and severity of severe weather events, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Achieving the 2oC goal will require drastic reductions in GHG emissions. Here, again, the agricultural sector is central. A wide range of agricultural activities emit GHGs 1 In this Guidance, the terms \u2018producer\u2019 and \u2018company\u2019 are used synonymously to refer to any entity that develops an inventory of the agricultural GHG emissions. The terms \u2018farm\u2019, \u2018farmland\u2019 and \u2018agricultural land\u2019 are also used interchangeably to refer to the land on which agriculture is practiced. 2 See paragraph 1 of \u2018Report of the Conference of the Parties on its fifteenth session, held in Copenhagen from 7 to 19 December 2009\u2019 (http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/6911.php?priref=600005735) 5\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance (Figure 1-1), and together they directly contributed about 11%3 of total global anthropogenic emissions in 2010, and roughly 60% of all nitrous oxide (N O) emissions 2 and 50% of all methane (CH ) emissions in 2007 (Smith et al., 2007a). Land use change 4 (LUC), caused by the conversion of native habitats to farmland, contributes a comparable amount of emissions (Houghton, 2012). Finally, the production of agricultural inputs and various downstream activities, such as the processing and transport of agricultural products, contributes a further 3 - 6 % of global emissions (Vermuelen et al., 2012).

The GHG Protocol is a multi-stakeholder partnership of businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), governments and others convened by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Launched in 1998, the mission of the GHG Protocol is to develop and promote the use of industry-accepted best practices for GHG accounting. To date, the GHG Protocol has released four standards that define best practices for how GHG emissions inventories should be performed at the enterprise, project, and product levels (Table 1-1). All publications are available from the GHG Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org). 3 Value calculated using data from Tubiello et al., (2014) and WRI (2014) 6\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Table 1-1.

The Corporate Standard provides a high-level, cross- This Guidance defines agriculture as sector accounting framework. But, it does not address the cultivation of animals, plants, many accounting and reporting issues specific to and fungi for food, fiber, biofuels, agriculture. These include: drugs or other purposes.* \uf0b7 The profound influence of environmental factors on agricultural GHG fluxes (emissions or removals)4, Definition developed by the stakeholders involved in this Guidance\u2019s development which complicates efforts to separate anthropogenic process. from non-anthropogenic effects and thus ensure that GHG inventories are useful as management tools. \uf0b7 Obtaining accurate, site-specific flux data when environmental conditions vary a lot across landscapes. \uf0b7 Setting and tracking progress toward emission reduction goals against a background of highly variable GHG fluxes. 4 GHG fluxes are the emissions to or removals from the atmosphere of GHGs. 7\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance \uf0b7 Carbon (C) sequestration and accounting for changes in the management and ownership of different carbon pools. \uf0b7 The fact that agricultural activities do not immediately result in GHG fluxes (e.g., delayed emissions from decomposition of post-harvest detritus). \uf0b7 The types of organizational structures and operational practices specific to agriculture. This Guidance outlines recommended methodologies to address these and other issues important to the sector, while incorporating requirements in the Corporate Standard. Because the agricultural sector is highly diverse, this Guidance aims to establish a common framework that is applicable to the myriad subsectors within agriculture. This Guidance can largely be used on its own for developing GHG inventories. However, it does not address certain topics covered by the Corporate Standard, such as the verification of GHG inventories or setting of GHG reduction targets (see Chapter 1.5). The specific objectives of this Guidance are to: \uf0b7 Increase consistency and transparency in GHG accounting and reporting within the agricultural sector. \uf0b7 Help companies cost-effectively prepare GHG inventories that are true and fair accounts of their climate impact. \uf0b7 Enable GHG inventories to meet the decision-making needs of both internal management and external stakeholders (e.g., investors) and so provide for the more effective management of agricultural GHG fluxes. What does this Guidance not do? This Guidance is squarely focused on corporate- or farm-level accounting and reporting issues and: \uf0b7 Does not advance methods for project- or product-level GHG accounting (e.g., product category rules). \uf0b7 Does not provide accounting methods for indirect Land Use Change (iLUC). iLUC occurs when an existing crop is diverted for another purpose, such as transportation fuel production, and replacement crops are then grown on formerly non-agricultural lands. An example of iLUC is when sugarcane is diverted from sugar to biofuel production, causing forests to be cleared for additional sugarcane production. Accounting for such iLUC impacts requires a project-based approach to determine what the GHG fluxes would have been in the absence of the market intervention. The Project Protocol provides general, high-level guidance that can help inform how to account for iLUC impacts. \uf0b7 Does not require sector-specific GHG performance metrics. The choice of a metric has to be guided by a company\u2019s objectives in developing an inventory and by the specific operations and sources that characterize that company. (Appendix I provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of different types of metrics.) \uf0b7 Does not require specific methods or tools for calculating agricultural GHG fluxes. \uf0b7 Does not provide guidance on the selection and deployment of GHG mitigation practices on farms. 8\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance \uf0b7 Does not address environmental impacts other than GHG fluxes, such as water use, eutrophication, and emissions of air pollutants. Consequently, this Guidance cannot be used by itself to evaluate the possible trade-offs between GHG emissions reductions and other environmental impacts of a given farming practice. 1.4 Who should use this Guidance? This Guidance is primarily intended for producers and companies that seek to develop scope 1 and 2 inventories of their agricultural operations (Box 1-1). Examples include fruit and crop growers, ranchers, and biofuel producers. While producers with small agricultural operations may find it difficult to devote the resources to use this Guidance, it is applicable to", "embedding_index": 2}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_3", "text": " evaluate the possible trade-offs between GHG emissions reductions and other environmental impacts of a given farming practice. 1.4 Who should use this Guidance? This Guidance is primarily intended for producers and companies that seek to develop scope 1 and 2 inventories of their agricultural operations (Box 1-1). Examples include fruit and crop growers, ranchers, and biofuel producers. While producers with small agricultural operations may find it difficult to devote the resources to use this Guidance, it is applicable to operations of all sizes. Box 1-1. The concept of scopes Under the Corporate Standard emissions sources are categorized as direct or indirect and then further divided into \u2018scopes\u2019: \uf0b7 Direct sources: Owned or controlled by the reporting company. All direct sources are classified as scope 1. \uf0b7 Indirect sources: Owned or controlled by another company, but a portion of whose emissions are a consequence of the activities of the reporting company. Indirect sources are either scope 2 or scope 3: scope 2 emissions stem from the generation of electricity, heat, or steam that is purchased by the reporting company, while scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions. The focus of this Guidance is on including scope 1 and scope 2 sources in inventories, although certain scope 3 sources are also discussed because they are highly emitting. 9\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Other users This Guidance will be helpful to downstream or upstream companies that seek to understand their value chain GHG impacts from agriculture. Downstream companies include processors (e.g., slaughterhouses and biofuel makers), brand manufacturers that make packaged food products, and retailers that make private label food products, while upstream companies include manufacturers of farm inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Agricultural emissions will often form a substantial part of the scope 3 inventories of these companies and will fall into the Scope 3 Standard\u2019s Category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services) and Category 11 (Use of Sold Products) for downstream and upstream companies, respectively. Companies completing a value chain assessment should consult the Scope 3 Standard for additional requirements and guidance on including agriculture in their inventories. GHG reporting programs and policy makers may also be interested in incorporating this Guidance into their policy or program design. Many companies in other sectors also have land-based GHG fluxes. Examples include the construction, mining, and utility sectors. While this Guidance is likely broadly applicable to these sectors, it has not been evaluated for use outside of the agricultural sector. 1.5 Relationship between this Guidance and the Corporate Standard The Corporate Standard outlines requirements and/or guidance on a range of topics, ranging from inventory design to tracking emissions over time. This Guidance summarizes and customizes most of this content to the agricultural sector, adding additional recommendations in many areas. However, this Guidance does not include guidance on inventory verification and target setting, and on other topics that are included in the Corporate Standard, but not relevant to the sector. For such guidance, users should consult the Corporate Standard. Table 1-2 maps the content of this Guidance onto that of the Corporate Standard, while Table 1-3 summarizes the main recommendations made in this Guidance. Note that, under the Corporate Standard, companies must report emissions of at least the seven Kyoto GHGs, which are: carbon dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), nitrous oxide 2 4 (N O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur hexaflouride (SF ), 2 6 and nitrogen triflouride (NF ). This same principle applies to companies using this 3 Guidance. However, agricultural activities typically generate only a subset of these GHGs (see Chapter 4). 10\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Table 1-2.

Product GHG inventories and corporate inventories (when scope 3 emissions are included) are complementary and they together provide a comprehensive approach to value chain GHG management. For example, product and corporate inventories are mutually supportive when: \uf0b7 Corporate inventories are used to identify products that are likely to have the most significant GHG footprints based on their use of highly emitting sources, such as specific raw materials (e.g., fertilizers). \uf0b7 Product inventories are used to inform GHG reduction strategies that impact both product and corporate inventories. \uf0b7 Product inventories are used to extrapolate to relevant upstream and downstream scope 3 emissions in a corporate inventory. Companies may wish to complete scope 3 and product GHG inventories in parallel. Alternatively, they may develop scope 1 and 2 inventories to supply information requested by a buyer for the purpose of its scope 3 and product inventories. In either case, companies should be mindful of certain differences between this Guidance and the Product Standard that can affect the extent to which both types of inventories are mutually supportive (Table 1-4). Table 1-4. Differences in methodologies between this Guidance and the Product Standard that affect how useful a corporate inventory is for product GHG inventories (and vice-versa). GHG reporting Recommendation in the Requirement in the Product Standard issue Agricultural Guidance Scope 3 sources Should be reported Emissions from all relevant upstream and downstream sources shall be reflected in the inventory of a given product (though downstream emissions need not be considered in cradle-to-farm gate analyses) CO fluxes \uf0b7 Should be reported The following fluxes shall be accounted for: 2 to/from carbon \uf0b7 CO emissions and removals due to C 2 stocks in soils stock change occurring as a result of land CO fluxes \uf0b7 CO emissions should be conversion within or between land use 2 2 to/from C stocks reported categories (e.g., adoption of no-till in biomass and \uf0b7 CO removals by woody practices or land use change) 2 dead organic vegetation should be \uf0b7 Emissions from the preparation of matter (DOM) reported converted land (e.g., biomass burning or \uf0b7 CO removals by liming) 2 herbaceous vegetation, \uf0b7 The CO fluxes to/from soils that occur 2 should not be reported as a result of subsequent land use (e.g., fertilizer application and harvesting) are optional and may be included, provided 15\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance GHG reporting Recommendation in the Requirement in the Product Standard issue Agricultural Guidance the fluxes can be estimated reasonably \uf0b7 Biogenic CO2 fluxes shall be reported separately from non-biogenic fluxes Timeline for Varies depending on site- In the context of land use change: 20 years amortizing the specific conditions or the length of one harvest, whichever is CO fluxes from longer 2 changes in carbon stocks 1.7 How does this guidance relate to the GHG Project Protocol? The revenue from offset credits is often mentioned as a leading reason for why agricultural companies should become interested in managing their GHG fluxes. Soil C sequestration, in particular, is considered an important potential source of offset credits because it offers most (~89%) of the global potential for reducing the emissions from agriculture (Smith et al., 2007b). The Corporate Standard, and therefore this Guidance, do not address the accounting steps needed to create offset credits from soils, biomass or other sources located on farms. For example, this Guidance does not consider the permanence of C sequestration", "embedding_index": 5}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_6", "text": " in managing their GHG fluxes. Soil C sequestration, in particular, is considered an important potential source of offset credits because it offers most (~89%) of the global potential for reducing the emissions from agriculture (Smith et al., 2007b). The Corporate Standard, and therefore this Guidance, do not address the accounting steps needed to create offset credits from soils, biomass or other sources located on farms. For example, this Guidance does not consider the permanence of C sequestration. Instead, fluxes to/from C stocks are simply reported as they occur (or projected to occur5) and there is no consideration of policy measures to ensure the permanence of sequestered C (e.g., insurance mechanisms, project buffers, etc.). For such guidance readers should instead refer to the Project Protocol and its companion document, the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry Guidance for GHG Project Accounting. 1.8 How was this Guidance developed? This Guidance is the culmination of an international, three-year stakeholder consultation process that involved over 150 Technical Working Group (TWG) members from businesses, government agencies, NGOs, and academic institutions. Milestones include: \uf0b7 January, 2011: Publication of WRI Working Paper \uf0b7 March, 2011: Formation of TWG \uf0b7 January, 2012: First draft of Guidance \uf0b7 April, 2012: Stakeholder workshop in Washington, DC \uf0b7 August, 2012: Second draft of Guidance \uf0b7 September, 2012: TWG workshop in Sao Paulo \uf0b7 January, 2013: TWG workshop in Sao Paulo \uf0b7 March \u2013 August, 2013: Road testing and public open comment period \uf0b7 October, 2013: Third draft of Guidance 5 Chapter 8 describes how projected changes in C stocks can be calculated and reflected in inventories. 16\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Chapter 2: Business goals The development of a GHG inventory can be a significant undertaking. Companies should therefore have clearly defined goals for managing their GHG fluxes and understand how inventories will allow them to meet those goals. Companies generally want their GHG inventories to be capable of serving multiple goals. It therefore makes sense to design the inventory process from the outset to provide information for a variety of different users and uses \u2013 both current and future. This chapter: \uf0d8 Reviews the various goals that GHG emissions inventories can help companies meet. \uf0d8 Describes the potential economic and environmental benefits from a range of GHG reduction measures. 2.1 Overview of business goals Agricultural companies can have diverse reasons for developing inventories. These reasons generally involve (Table 2-1): \uf0b7 Identifying opportunities to reduce GHG emissions (or sequester C), setting baselines and reduction targets, and tracking performance. \uf0b7 Identifying opportunities to reduce costs and increase productivity (e.g., conservation tillage and cover cropping can help to reduce fertilizer and fuel costs; Table 2-2). \uf0b7 Managing reputational risks and opportunities associated with agricultural GHG fluxes (e.g., meeting the requirements of buyers such as processors and food and drink companies, and reporting to civil society). \uf0b7 A desire to sustain farmlands for future generations. GHG emissions reduction measures may also offer co-benefits such as: \uf0b7 Reduced erosion and land degradation \uf0b7 Reduced phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) runoff \uf0b7 Improved water quality and retention \uf0b7 Control of air pollutants (e.g, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide) \uf0b7 Increased soil fertility Often, these co-benefits can help to reduce costs and increase productivity on farms. Table 2-2 summarizes common agricultural practices that provide GHG and other benefits. Stockwell & Bitan (2011) provide further information on these practices. Because agro-ecosystems are inherently complex, reduction measures should not be selected in isolation of each other, but rather selected using a whole-farm or systems approach. This ensures that interactions between the C and nitrogen (N) cycles on farms, as well as trade-offs between the emissions of different GHGs, are taken into account and that reduction measures can be more effectively integrated into individual farming 17\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance systems (see Chapter 7.1).

This chapter: \uf0d8 Introduces GHG accounting and reporting principles as they apply to farms, businesses and others in the agriculture sector. 3.1 Overview of principles GHG accounting and reporting shall be based on the following principles: Relevance: The GHG inventory shall appropriately reflect the GHG fluxes of the company and serve the decision-making needs of users \u2013 both internal and external to the company. Completeness: Companies shall account for and report on all GHG emission sources and activities within the inventory boundary, to the extent practicable and relevant to the purpose of the inventory. Any specific exclusions shall be disclosed and justified. Consistency: Companies shall use consistent methodologies to allow for meaningful performance tracking and comparison of GHG flux data over time, business units, geographies or suppliers. Transparency: Companies shall address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based on a clear audit trail. Companies shall also disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate references to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources used. Accuracy: Companies shall ensure that estimates of GHG fluxes are as accurate as possible and that they are not systematically over or under actual fluxes, as far as can be judged. A level of accuracy is needed that will allow users to make decisions with reasonable confidence as to the integrity of the reported information. The accuracy of GHG flux data is a particular concern for many agricultural GHG sources, including C stocks, soils, and enteric fermentation (see Chapter 7). Reporting on measures taken to ensure accuracy and improve accuracy over time can help promote the credibility and enhance the transparency of inventories. In practice, companies may encounter trade-offs between principles when completing an inventory. In particular, a company may find that achieving the most complete inventory requires the use of less accurate data, compromising overall accuracy. Conversely, 22\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance achieving the most accurate inventory may require the exclusion of activities with low accuracy, compromising overall completeness. Companies should balance tradeoffs between principles depending on their individual business goals. For instance, relatively less accurate data may be appropriate for the initial evaluation of GHG reduction opportunities, whereas more accurate data may be required to track progress toward a specific GHG reduction target. 23\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Chapter 4: Overview of agricultural emission sources Many different types of emission sources are associated with agriculture, such as fuel use, soils, and manure management. Understanding the qualitative differences amongst these is crucial to many steps in inventory development, including calculating, reporting, and undertaking the quality control of GHG flux data. This chapter: \uf0d8 Distinguishes between two types of emissions sources \u2013 mechanical and non- mechanical sources \u2013 whose fluxes differ in fundamental ways, with important implications for GHG inventory development. \uf0d8 Describes the variety and relative importance of these sources along agricultural value chains. 4.1 Overview of agricultural sources Figure 4-1 lists the principal emission sources found on farmland. An important distinction for the agricultural sector is between mechanical and non-mechanical sources. This is because agriculture relies on biological systems, whose emissions or removals of GHGs generally occur through much more complex mechanisms than the emissions from the mechanical equipment used on farmland. Non-mechanical sources are either biological processes shaped by climatic and soil conditions (e.g., decomposition) or the burning of crop residues. They are often connected by complex patterns of N and C flows through farms. Non-mechanical sources emit CO , CH and N O (or precursors of these GHGs) through different routes. CO 2 4 2 2 fluxes are mostly controlled by uptake through plant photosynthesis and releases via respiration, decomposition and the combustion of organic matter. In turn, N O emissions 2 result from nitrification and denitrification (see Box 4-1), and CH emissions result from 4 methanogenesis under anaerobic conditions in soils and manure storage, enteric fermentation, and the incomplete combustion of organic matter. Mechanical sources are equipment or machinery operated on farms, such as mobile machinery (e.g., harvesters), stationary equipment (e.g., boilers), and refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. These sources emit CO , CH , and N O, or H", "embedding_index": 8}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_9", "text": " nitrification and denitrification (see Box 4-1), and CH emissions result from 4 methanogenesis under anaerobic conditions in soils and manure storage, enteric fermentation, and the incomplete combustion of organic matter. Mechanical sources are equipment or machinery operated on farms, such as mobile machinery (e.g., harvesters), stationary equipment (e.g., boilers), and refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. These sources emit CO , CH , and N O, or HFCs and PFCs, 2 4 2 and their emissions are wholly determined by the properties of the source equipment and material inputs (e.g., fuel composition). 24\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Figure 4-1.

The exact contribution of agriculture to global CO emissions is hard 2 to quantify. This is because the biomass and soil C pools not only emit large amounts of CO , but also take up CO . Nevertheless, additional C sequestration offers most (~89%) 2 2 of the global emissions mitigation potential in agriculture (Smith et al., 2007b). Agriculture-driven LUC is also a globally important source of CO emissions. 2 At the farm scale, the relative magnitude of different emission sources and of different GHGs will vary widely depending on the type of farm, management practices, and natural factors at play. These factors include original land cover; farm topography and hydrology; soil microbial density and ecology; soil temperature, moisture, organic content and composition; crop or livestock type; and land and waste management practices. Few studies have looked at the relative contribution of different sources to the whole-farm inventories of different farming systems using a consistent set of methods. It is difficult to accurately predict the relative magnitude of different sources for a given farm. Nonetheless, certain broad patterns can be expected (e.g., Figure 4-3). 25\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Figure 4-2. Relative contribution of different agricultural sources to global anthropogenic emissions (percent) 1% Fertiliser / waste application 2% 6% Enteric fermentation 7% Biomass burning 34% 10% Rice cultivation Manure 11% Irrigation Farm machinery 29% Soil carbon (net emissions basis) Notes: 1.

Figure based on expert opinion of the Technical Working Group. 4.2 Individual agricultural sources Non-mechanical sources The non-mechanical sources that are globally largest in magnitude are: Enteric fermentation (CH ) 4 CH is produced in herbivores as a by-product of enteric fermentation, whereby 4 carbohydrates are broken down by bacteria in the digestive tract. The amount of CH that 4 is produced depends on: \uf0b7 The type of animal. Ruminant livestock have an expansive chamber, the rumen, which fosters extensive enteric fermentation and high CH emissions. The main 4 ruminant livestock are cattle, buffalo, goats, sheep, and deer. Non-ruminant livestock (horses, mules, donkeys) and monogastric livestock (swine) have relatively lower CH emissions. 4 \uf0b7 Quantity and composition of feed. Generally, the higher the feed intake, the higher the CH emissions. 4 \uf0b7 Age and size of livestock. Feed intake increases with animal size, growth rate, and production (e.g., milk production, wool growth, or pregnancy). Soil amendments and soil management (N O) 2 Direct and indirect emissions of N O also occur from soils following increases in 2 available N (see Box 4-1) from: \uf0b7 Synthetic N fertilizers and organic fertilizers (e.g., animal manure, compost, sewage sludge, and rendering waste). \uf0b7 Urine and dung that is deposited onto pastures, ranges and paddocks by grazing animals. \uf0b7 Incorporation of crop residues into soils and N-fixation by legumes. (Note: crop residue management and legume growing can reduce field fertilizer requirements and ultimately reduce overall soil N O emissions.) 2 \uf0b7 N mineralisation associated with the loss of soil organic matter and caused by changes in land use or soil management, such as the drainage or management of organic soils (i.e. histosols). Manure management (CH and N O) 4 2 Manure management releases both CH and N O, although the emissions of these GHGs 4 2 are influenced by different factors. 27\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance CH is emitted during the storage and treatment of manure under anaerobic conditions. It 4 is most readily emitted when: \uf0b7 Large numbers of animals are managed in a confined area (e.g., dairy farms, beef feedlots, and swine and poultry farms). \uf0b7 When manure is stored or treated as a liquid (e.g., in lagoons, ponds, tanks, or pits). In contrast, when manure is handled as a solid (e.g., in stacks or piles) or when it is deposited onto pastures and rangelands, it tends to decompose under more aerobic conditions, producing less CH . 4 N O is emitted either directly or indirectly from stored or treated manures (see Box 4-1). 2 N O emissions are influenced by: 2 \uf0b7 The N and C content of the manure, and the duration of storage and type of treatment. \uf0b7 Temperature and time - comparatively simple forms of organic N, such as urea (mammals) and uric acid (poultry) tend to lead to indirect N O emissions more 2 quickly. \uf0b7 The leaching and run-off of N from treatment units. 28\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Box 4-1. Indirect and direct N O emissions from soils 2 N O emissions on farms are controlled by the supply of available N. Increases in available N, 2 through the addition of fertilizers or animal wastes to soils, or from the storage and treatment of manure, stimulate denitrification and nitrification processes, which lead to N O emissions. The 2 actual N O emissions may occur directly from the site of manure storage or fertilizer application, 2 or they may occur indirectly, via leaching and volatilization. Volatilized N is ultimately deposited onto soils or onto the surface of lakes and other water bodies, where N O emissions then occur. 2 Leached N leads to N O emissions in the groundwater below the farm and", "embedding_index": 10}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_11", "text": " stimulate denitrification and nitrification processes, which lead to N O emissions. The 2 actual N O emissions may occur directly from the site of manure storage or fertilizer application, 2 or they may occur indirectly, via leaching and volatilization. Volatilized N is ultimately deposited onto soils or onto the surface of lakes and other water bodies, where N O emissions then occur. 2 Leached N leads to N O emissions in the groundwater below the farm and in ditches, rivers, 2 estuaries, etc., that eventually receive the leachate. While indirect N O emissions may occur off 2 the farm, they are accounted for in the same way as direct N O emissions in this Guidance. 2 DIRECT N2O EMISSIONS Volatization Volatization Storage / treatment Soil Addition of unit manure Addition of fertilizer / farm Deposition wastes Deposition Leaching / run\u2010off DIRECT N2O EMISSIONS = Enhancement of denitrification and nitrification processes from increase in available N Rice cultivation The anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces CH , 4 which escapes to the atmosphere, mostly by transport through the rice plants. The CH 4 emissions will depend on the number and duration of crops grown, water regimes before and during the cultivation period, and organic and inorganic soil amendments. Soil type, temperature, and rice cultivar are also important. 29\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Soil liming Liming is used to reduce soil acidity and improve plant growth. When added to soils, carbonate limes such as limestone (CaCO ) or dolomite (CaMg(CO ) ) dissolve and may 3 3 2 release bicarbonate (HCO -), which then forms CO through additional chemical 3 2 reactions. Whether CO is emitted and the amount of emissions depends on soil factors, 2 climate regime, and the type of lime applied (i.e., limestone or dolomite, fine or course textured). Non-carbonate limes, such as oxides (e.g., CaO) and hydroxides of lime, do not result in CO emissions on farms, but their production causes CO emissions from the 2 2 breakdown of carbonate raw materials. Management of carbon pools The agricultural sector differs profoundly from industrial sectors in the importance of C pools, which may act either as sources or sinks of CO during agricultural land use or 2 LUC. These pools are of four main types (Figure 4-4): \uf0b7 Above-ground and below-ground biomass (e.g., trees, crops and roots). \uf0b7 Dead organic matter (DOM) in or on soils (i.e., decaying wood and leaf litter). \uf0b7 Soil organic matter. This category includes all non-living biomass that is too fine to be recognized as dead organic matter. \uf0b7 Harvested products. Generally, this pool is short-lived in the agricultural sector as crop products are rapidly consumed following harvesting. Harvested wood products (HWPs) are a potential exception. It is possible to disaggregate these pools further. For instance, the DOM and biomass pools can be subdivided into understory vegetation, standing dead tree, down dead tree, and litter pools, etc. This level of disaggregation may be useful depending on data availability and the intended accuracy of the inventory (see Chapter 8). Carbon stocks represent the quantity of C stored in pools. It may take C stocks decades to reach equilibrium following a change in farm management. Ultimately, for agricultural land as a whole to sequester C, the sum of all stock increases must exceed the sum of all stock decreases (i.e., the sum of all C gains through CO fixation must exceed the sum of 2 all C losses through CO andCH emissions and harvested products). 2 4 Soil carbon pools Both organic and inorganic forms of C exist and are found in soils. However, agriculture has a larger impact on organic C pools, which are found in organic and mineral soils. \uf0b7 Organic C pools in organic soils. Organic soils (e.g., those in peat and muck) have a high percentage of organic matter by mass and develop under the poorly drained conditions of wetlands when inputs of organic matter exceed losses of C from anaerobic decomposition. The drainage of organic soils to prepare land for agriculture leads to CO emissions - emission rates vary by climate, with drainage under warmer 2 conditions leading to faster decomposition rates. CO emissions are also influenced 2 by drainage depth, liming, and the fertility and consistency of the organic substrate. 30\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance \uf0b7 Organic C pools in mineral soils. All soils that are not organic soils are classified as mineral soils. They typically have relatively low amounts of organic matter, occur under moderate to well drained conditions, and predominate in most ecosystems, except wetlands.

All soils that are not organic soils are classified as mineral soils. They typically have relatively low amounts of organic matter, occur under moderate to well drained conditions, and predominate in most ecosystems, except wetlands. The organic C stocks of mineral soils can change if the net balance between C inputs and C losses from the soil is altered. C inputs can occur through the incorporation of biomass residues into soils after harvesting and fires, or through the direct additions of C in organic amendments. C losses are largely controlled by decomposition and are influenced by changes in moisture and temperature, soil properties and soil disturbance. Figure 4-4. Carbon pools in agriculture Mechanical sources The following categories of mechanical sources exist on farms: \uf0b7 Stationary and mobile combustion sources. Stationary combustion sources are devices such as boilers, furnaces, and electric generators and are used to power a wide range of equipment, such as milling and irrigation equipment. Mobile combustion sources are vehicles and mobile equipment, such as tractors, combine harvesters, and trucks. The CO emissions from all combustion sources are 2 primarily determined by the C content of the fuel used. In contrast, the CH and 4 31\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance N O emissions are primarily determined by the combustion and emissions control 2 technologies present. \uf0b7 Purchased electricity. The associated emissions will depend on the mix of fuel types and technologies used on the grid concerned. \uf0b7 Refrigerant and air-conditioning equipment. These equipment leak refrigerants \u2013 high Global Warming Potential (GWP) GHGs - during installation, maintenance, operation and disposal. 4.3 Off-site emission sources beyond the farm gate The relative importance of different upstream and downstream processes will vary, depending on the proximity to markets (i.e. transportation distance), the amount of processing and packaging, and the type and volume of farm inputs (especially fertilizer). The following sources will be important for many types of farms: Fertilizer production The GHG emissions from fertilizer production are closely linked to energy consumption and vary with aspects of plant design and efficiency, emissions control technologies, and raw material inputs. Three raw materials are particularly important: \u2010 Ammonia. CO is emitted from the consumption of hydrocarbons (primarily 2 natural gas) as a hydrocarbon feedstock (to supply H) and as an energy source. \u2010 Nitric acid (HNO ). Nitric acid production is the largest industrial source of N O 3 2 (IPCC 2006) and is emitted as a byproduct of the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid. \u2010 Phosphoric acid. Produced from reacting phosphate rock with sulphuric acid. The resultant emissions are mainly of CO , from fuel use and from the C compounds 2 contained in the rock. To a large degree, the GHGs embedded in a fertilizer product will reflect the relative amounts of these ingredients. Feed production Globally, feed production accounts for 45% of the product-level GHG emissions across all types of livestock (Gerber et al., 2013). It is more important in the life cycle inventories of egg, chicken and pork, compared to those of milk and beef, where enteric fermentation dominates. Feed production emissions come from many of the sources described in Chapter 4.2; particularly, soil management, LUC, and fertilizer production, as well as electricity use during drying and processing. Refrigeration Refrigeration is the major GHG-intensive component of the downstream supply chain. Refrigeration emissions occur during initial chilling, transport, storage, catering and retail. Limited data are available, but this \u201ccold chain\u201d could account for about one percent of global GHG emissions (James and James, 2010). 32\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Part 2: DEVELOPING CORPORATE INVENTORIES 33\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Chapter 5: Setting Inventory Boundaries Agricultural companies vary tremendously in terms of their organizational structures and business operations. Common examples include the degree of vertical integration, the types of leases entered into for land and equipment, and the manner in which agricultural products are sold off the farm. This variation poses a challenge to ensuring that emissions sources are included in inventories in a consistent way over time, both within and across companies. Fortunately, specific approaches are available to help companies determine which sources should be included \u2013 these approaches relate to setting inventory boundaries. This chapter: \uf0d8 Describes approaches for setting organizational boundaries to determine which business operations should be included in an inventory. \uf0d8 Describes approaches for setting operational boundaries that define whether and how emissions sources associated with these operations should be reported in inventories.

This chapter: \uf0d8 Describes approaches for setting organizational boundaries to determine which business operations should be included in an inventory. \uf0d8 Describes approaches for setting operational boundaries that define whether and how emissions sources associated with these operations should be reported in inventories. Summary of requirements and main recommendations: \uf0d8 Companies shall separately account for and report on scope 1 and 2 at a minimum. \uf0d8 When setting operational boundaries, companies should take appropriate account of production contracts and other forms of agricultural contracting, land and equipment leases, and membership of co-operatives. 5.1 Setting organizational boundaries Organizational boundaries determine which land and operating facilities, such as barns and processing plants (collectively termed \u2018operations\u2019 in this Guidance), shall be included in an inventory. Three \u2018consolidation\u2019 approaches can be used to set organizational boundaries: 1. Operational control. A company accounts for 100% of the GHG fluxes to/from an operation over which it has the authority to introduce and implement its own operating policies. 2. Financial control. A company accounts for 100% of the fluxes to/from an operation over which it has the ability to direct financial and operating policies with a view to gaining economic benefits. 3. Equity-share approach. A company accounts for the fluxes to/from an operation according to its share of equity (or percentage of economic interest) in that operation. Various criteria can be used by companies to determine if they exert operational control of an operation. For instance, operational control would be held if: \u2022 The operation is operated by the reporting company, whether for itself or under a contractual obligation to other owners or participants in the operation. 34\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance \u2022 The operation is operated by a joint venture (or equivalent), in respect of which the reporting company has the ability to determine management and board-level decisions of the joint venture. \u2022 The reporting company holds an operating license. \u2022 The reporting company sets environmental, health and safety policies. A company must use only one consolidation approach (and related criterion) in creating an inventory, although it may choose to create multiple inventories using different approaches. Many agricultural businesses are organized as sole proprietorships or family businesses and their organizational boundaries will be correspondingly simple. As business structures become more complex, organizational boundaries will become more valuable in ensuring consistent accounting practices. Exactly which agricultural operations are included in an inventory will depend on the business structures involved and the chosen consolidation approach (Table 5-1). For example, the member-patrons of a co-operative would not account for any of that co-operative\u2019s fluxes under the financial control approach, but they would account for those fluxes under the equity share approach (Table 5-1). Figure 5-1 illustrates the application of organizational boundaries for different accounting categories. Co-operatives are considered further in Chapter 5.2. This Guidance makes no recommendations about which consolidation approach should be used in the sector. Rather, many companies will likely need to consider a range of factors when selecting an approach and that selection should be based on the reporting company\u2019s business goals for GHG reporting (Table 5-2). For instance, a company with a large cattle feedlot may fall under the jurisdiction of a mandatory GHG reporting program. Because compliance with such programs typically rests with the operators of emission sources, the company may choose the operational control approach to streamline its reporting processes. In general, sole proprietorships will typically find the operational control the most straightforward approach to apply, while companies with other business structures may prefer any of the three approaches based on their specific business goals.

These boundaries define whether an emission source is direct (i.e., is controlled or owned by the reporting company) or indirect (i.e., owned or controlled by another company, but a portion of whose emissions are a consequence of the activities of the reporting company). Emission sources are further classified by scope (Box 1-1): \uf0d8 Scope 1: All direct sources \uf0d8 Scope 2: Consumption of purchased heat, steam and electricity (an indirect source) \uf0d8 Scope 3: All other indirect sources All scope 1 and 2 sources shall be reported in an inventory. Scope 3 sources are optional under the Corporate Standard, although it is recommended to measure and report significant scope 3 sources (see Chapter 9.3). Also, with the exception of LUC, all CO 2 fluxes to/from C pools that are owned or controlled by the reporting company should be reported separately from the scopes in a special \u2018Biogenic Carbon\u2019 category. Biogenic CO fluxes are considered further in Chapters 8 and 9. 2 37\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance What factors affect how operational boundaries are set? Companies may encounter the following factors for consideration when determining which scope a given source falls under: 1. Production contracts Agricultural products can be sold in various ways, including production contracts, marketing contracts and spot markets (Figure 5-2). Production contracts are distinct in that they are agreements between contractors (often called growers) and contractees (often called integrators) that cede some measure of control over the production process to the integrator. The contract specifies: (1) the services to be provided by the grower (e.g., fertilizer application schedules, husbandry conditions); (2) the manner in which the grower is to be compensated for the services; and (3) specific integrator responsibilities for the provision of any inputs. There are many different types of production contracts, which vary according to whether the integrator or grower owns the product during production; whether the terms of the contract are non-negotiable; and the extent to which the integrator provides inputs. For the purposes of reporting under this Guidance, growers are assumed to retain operational control over the contracted production and should therefore account for 100% of the associated emissions under scope 1 or 2 using the operational control approach. The accounting under financial or equity share approaches may differ. In particular, if the integrator has established multi-year contracts with individual growers and provides extensive inputs, the integrators and growers should each then account for a portion of the emissions", "embedding_index": 14}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_15", "text": " extent to which the integrator provides inputs. For the purposes of reporting under this Guidance, growers are assumed to retain operational control over the contracted production and should therefore account for 100% of the associated emissions under scope 1 or 2 using the operational control approach. The accounting under financial or equity share approaches may differ. In particular, if the integrator has established multi-year contracts with individual growers and provides extensive inputs, the integrators and growers should each then account for a portion of the emissions according to their share of investments in the production process. Figure 5-2. Primary sales routes for agricultural products 2. Other forms of agricultural contracting While companies can enter into production contracts that require them to raise livestock or grow crops for third parties, they may enter into other types of contracts that require third parties to perform agricultural activities on their own behalf. These activities may take place either on or off the reporting companies\u2019 farmland. 38\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance On-farm activities: Companies may contract third parties to perform a subset of farming activities, such as harvesting or fertilizer application (see the example of service co- operatives below). At the other end of the spectrum, landowners may enter into custom farming contracts under which contract operators supply all the labor and equipment needed to perform tillage, planting, pest control, harvesting, crop storage, and other farm functions. With the exception of contractor-owned equipment, the on-farm sources are scope 3 for the contractor and scope 1 for the producer/landowner, under both the operational and financial control approaches. Off-farm activities: Many different arrangements exist for the grazing or feeding of a company\u2019s livestock on a third party\u2019s land. Examples include feedlots and ajistments6. While the livestock are on the third party\u2019s land, the agricultural emissions (e.g., CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management) are scope 1 for the third party and scope 3 for the producer, under both the operational and financial control approaches. 3. Leases for land and equipment The Corporate Standard (Appendix F) distinguishes between two general types of leases: \uf0b7 Capital (or financial) leases: This type of lease enables the lessee to operate an asset and also gives the lessee all the risks and rewards of owning that asset. In a capital lease the lessee has use of the asset over most of its useful life. Assets leased under a capital or financial lease are considered wholly-owned assets in financial accounting and are recorded as such on the balance sheet. \uf0b7 Operational leases: This type of lease enables the lessee to operate an asset, such as a building or a vehicle, but does not give the lessee any of the risks or rewards of owning that asset. In an operating lease the lessee only has use of the asset for some of its useful life. Any lease that is not a capital or financial lease is an operating lease. Whether leased assets are scope 1 or 3 for the reporting company depends on the approach chosen to set organizational boundaries and on the type of leasing arrangement (see Table 5-3 and Table 5-4). Land leases and operational control For the purposes of reporting under this Guidance, the reporting company is considered to exert operational control of any land it leases (Table 5-3). This is true, regardless of the form of rent payment (cash, crops, or both), the amount of resources contributed by the landlord, or the extent to which the landlord is involved in management decisions. For instance, permits for the lease of national-owned grazing lands from governments might contain requirements related to resting periods and reseeding. The lessee retains operational control of the land in these cases. 6 Ajistments are typically defined for a shorter period of time than pasture or grazing leases, which are considered separately in \u201cLeases for land and equipment\u201d 39\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Table 5-3.

Membership of co-operatives A co-operative is a business that is owned and controlled by the member organizations that use its services and whose benefits are shared by the members on the basis of use (Table 5-1). Agricultural co-operatives take many forms, but can broadly be grouped into marketing, purchasing, and service co-operatives (Table 5-5). Accounting under the equity share approach. Many producers will have a relatively small percentage patronage of their co-operative and need not account for its emissions under the equity share approach. However, some producers may have a significant percentage patronage and should account for a corresponding percentage of the co-operative\u2019s scope 1, scope 2, and (optionally) scope 3 emissions under the equity share approach. Note that the nature of the emissions source will vary widely depending on the type of co-operative 40\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance (see Table 5-5). For instance, the members of a purchasing co-operative would have scope 1 emissions relating to the manufacture of feed and fertilizer. Accounting under either control approach. A Co-operative does not fall within the organizational boundaries of its members and only the co-operative itself should account for its emissions under scope 1 and 2. Individual members may account for certain emissions under scope 3 should those arise from activities conducted by the co-operative specifically on their own behalf (and not on that of other members). For instance, the member of a service co-operative might account for the emissions from the co- operative\u2019s processing of animal feed, should that feed be used by that member (the relevant scope 3 category is Category 1: \u201cPurchased goods and services\u201d). Table 5-5. Co-operatives and operational boundaries Type of co-operative Co-operative activity Marketing Negotiate prices and terms of sale of their members\u2019 products with buyers Process members\u2019 products into other products Distribute members\u2019 products to retailers under own brand name Purchasing Provide access to production supplies such as feed, fuel, fertilizer, and seed Produce fertilizers and feed Service Provide farm-specific services, such as applying fertilizer, lime, or pesticides; processing animal feed; and harvesting crops 41\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Chapter 6: Tracking GHG fluxes over Time Setting and using base periods is a fundamental step in designing GHG inventories. They help companies compare performance against a point in the past and they put the effects of changes in inventory methodologies into context, allowing meaningful and consistent comparisons of performance over time. Agricultural activities and environmental conditions that affect GHG fluxes can change a lot over time. Also, structural changes such as acquisitions, divestments, and mergers, can affect the types of operations that need to be reported in inventories. Companies need to take these changes into account whilst setting and using base periods. This chapter: \uf0d8 Details requirements and recommendations for choosing a base period and for recalculating base period data to ensure historical comparisons are meaningful. Summary of requirements and main recommendations: \uf0d8 Companies shall choose and establish a base period, and specify the reasons for choosing that period. \uf0d8 The base period shall be the earliest point in time for which verifiable data are available on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. \uf0d8 Multi-year base periods are recommended for many companies. \uf0d8 Companies shall develop a base period emissions recalculation policy, and clearly articulate the basis and context for any recalculations. If applicable, the policy shall state any \u201csignificant threshold\u201d. \uf0d8 Companies shall recalculate the base period inventory to reflect changes in organizational structures or calculation methods, or the discovery of errors, which significantly impact the base period inventory. 6.1 Setting base periods The base period is the period in history against which an organization\u2019s GHG fluxes are tracked over time7.

Both the Corporate Standard and this Guidance require companies to establish a base period. Companies shall use as a base period the earliest relevant point in time for which they have verifiable data on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. Critically, the base period should be representative of a company\u2019s GHG profile. This has several implications: Base periods shall not be less than one year The base period should not be an individual crop year or production season (for livestock) that is less than one year. Otherwise, the effects of seasonal management activities may not be reflected in the base period. For instance, tillage practices, winter cover crops and double cropping systems can cause emissions outside of the growing 7 The Corporate Standard uses the term \u2018base year\u2019 instead of \u2018base period.\u2019 The latter term is used here to avoid confusion because base periods may comprise more than one year. 42\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance season. Also, the length of crop years and production seasons will vary between regions, potentially compromising the comparability of data from different facilities owned by the reporting company. Multi-year base periods are recommended Oftentimes, individual years will not serve as representative base periods (see Table 6.1 for examples). In such cases, companies should average GHG flux data from multiple, consecutive years to form a more representative base period. In general, this Guidance recommends at least a three-year base period, which is often sufficient to smooth over inter-annual variability. If a base year has already been set for non-agricultural emissions, then a multi-year base period can be centered on that year. Many calculation methodologies (e.g., Tier 1 IPCC methodologies; see Chapter 7.3) do not capture the effects of climate or environmental change on GHG fluxes. Instead, they only pick up changes in activity data (e.g., number of hectares farmed, number of cattle raised, amount of fertilizer used, etc.). As a result, if management practices in an individual year are representative, it may be appropriate to select that year as the base period. Table 6-1. Examples of when an individual year may not serve as a representative base period Why is the selected base period Examples atypical? Changes in environmental conditions During a single growing season, a heat wave occur that are beyond the control of the increases irrigation and therefore fuel use company and that cause the base period requirements inventory to depart significantly from typical GHG flux profiles Atypical or episodic changes in farming Coppiced woodland is returned to crop production practices Forest is cleared for agricultural production Agricultural activities vary cyclically over A multi-year multiple crop rotation a set period of years, such that activities Coppicing of short-rotation woody crops (e.g., a row (and corresponding GHG fluxes) in one of willows that is harvested every three years) year differ from those in other years Rotational applications of lime within the same cycle Rolling base periods may be useful Rolling base periods are base periods that move forward in time with each reporting period. They are useful because long-term environmental trends, such as changes in precipitation and temperature that accompany climate change, can affect agricultural GHG fluxes. As a result, the more widely separated the current reporting period is from a fixed base period, the more likely it is that at least some of the difference in GHG fluxes between the two periods is due to these trends. Therefore, companies may use a rolling base period to help minimize the influence of these long-term trends and ensure that inventories are more useful as a basis for tracking the impacts of management practices. 43\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Using a rolling base period involves moving the base period forward with each reporting period (Figure 6-1). One disadvantage to rolling base periods is that they do not allow reduction targets to be expressed as a percentage reduction relative to a fixed point in the past, which is the most common form of expressing reduction targets.

To ensure consistent tracking of GHG fluxes over time, the base period inventory shall be recalculated when changes occur to the inventory boundaries or inventory development process that would significantly impact the base inventory. These changes include: \uf0b7 Structural changes that transfer the ownership or control of operations from one company to another as long as those operations existed in the base period of the reporting company. Examples: mergers, acquisitions, and divestments (see Figure 6-2). \uf0b7 Changes in calculation methodologies. Example: the use of improved emission factors. \uf0b7 The discovery of errors that are significant on their own or collectively. Example: the discovery of errors in activity data. In determining whether changes are significant, companies should set significance thresholds (i.e., changes are cumulatively significant if they cause a change that exceeds x% of the base period inventory). The GHG Protocol does not define significance thresholds, although many GHG reporting programs do provide recommended thresholds. Once defined, a significance threshold should be applied consistently over time. 44 xulfGHGfo tnuomA Base period Current reporting period\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Figure 6-2. Recalculating base period inventories for structural changes. Here, the reporting company acquires a business at the beginning of year 3. The emissions from that business during year 3 are reflected in the reporting company\u2019s inventory for that year, but the inventories for the base period and year 2 are recalculated to include the acquired business\u2019s emissions during those two years. Changes that do not trigger recalculations \uf0b7 Organic growth or decline. Organic growth and decline is defined as increases or decreases in production output, changes in product mix, or closures and openings of operating units that are owned or controlled by the reporting company. For instance, an egg producer would experience organic growth if it increased production, perhaps by building a new facility, but it would not experience organic growth if it bought out a pre-existing facility. Changes in the amount of land leased by a company are also considered organic change and do not trigger recalculations, even if that action substantially increases production levels. \uf0b7 The acquisition (or insourcing) of an operation that did not exist in the base period of the reporting company. \uf0b7 Operational changes, such as switching from a feedlot to a rotational grazing operation, assuming both operations are owned or controlled by the reporting company. 45\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Chapter 7: Calculating GHG Fluxes Calculating GHG fluxes can be the most challenging part of developing GHG inventories in the agricultural sector. Companies should first identify the management practices and emissions sources that would need to be reflected in their inventories (see Chapter 4 and Chapter 5), before selecting a calculation approach. This selection is a key step, because the likely accuracy of GHG flux data and the types of activity data needed vary widely amongst approaches. Figure 7-1 shows the general process for calculating GHG fluxes. Figure 7-1. General process for calculating GHG flux data. Activity data: Data on farm inputs (e.g., amount of fertilizer used) Data on farm production Calculation GHG flux data (e.g., number of approach livestock grown) Data on environmental factors (e.g., soil type, climate, and weather) This chapter: \uf0b7 Describes the types of activity data typically needed to calculate GHG fluxes. \uf0b7 Provides guidance on prioritizing emissions sources for data collection. \uf0b7 Describes the general approaches for calculating the GHG fluxes to/from agricultural, especially non-mechanical, sources. \uf0b7 Describes criteria that are useful in selecting specific calculation tools. \uf0b7 Describes common sources of uncertainty in calculating GHG data that offer opportunities for improving inventory quality. 46\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Summary of requirements and main recommendations: \uf0d8 When high-quality activity data are not available for all of the emissions sources that need to be included in an inventory, companies should prioritize their data collection efforts based on source magnitude. \uf0d8 Companies should select a calculation approach that best meets their objectives for compiling an inventory and the GHG accounting and reporting principles. \uf0d8 When managing inventory quality, companies should focus on reducing parameter uncertainty. \uf0d8 Information on GHG data uncertainty should be reported in inventories.

Note: Prior to calculating GHG fluxes, companies should also consult Chapter 8, which details the specific types of C stock changes that should be included in an inventory and for which calculations are therefore recommended. 7.1 Collecting activity data Activity data can often be collected from existing data records held by producers, such as: invoices, electricity meters, crop insurance records, field records of tractor passes and crop operations, production records, land registry records, nutrient management plans, and livestock movement records. To the extent possible, these records should be used to reduce the GHG reporting burden and improve the audit trail. In general, data on energy consumption, procurement and production levels can often be obtained from high quality sources. In contrast, reliable data on land management practices and LUC can be more difficult to obtain. Table 7-1 summarizes common types of required activity data. Companies should consult individual calculation tools to determine their exact data requirements. It is recommended that large operations with geographically separated facilities should standardize inventory procedures and keep central records. Common challenges Certain challenges are commonly encountered when collecting activity data (Table 7-2). Companies should be mindful of these challenges when designing inventories and inventory quality management plans. 47\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Table 7-1.

As a result, data collection efforts should be prioritized. Companies should prioritize data collection efforts for key sources Key sources are those that are expected to have the highest GHG fluxes, offer the most emissions reduction potential, and are most relevant to the company\u2019s business goals (Table 7-3). The identification of key sources should take into account the range of different GHGs emitted from individual sources, because of the potential for trade-offs in GHG fluxes (see Chapter 7.3) and also because companies might have different amounts of control over the different sources. Collecting higher quality data for key sources will allow companies to more effectively set reduction targets and track and demonstrate progress over time, while making the most efficient use of available resources. For the same reasons, the key sources should also be subject to the most accurate quantification methods and the focus of quality analysis/quality control procedures. Table 7-3. Criteria for prioritizing data collection efforts Criterion Application to source (or sink) Magnitude of The source (or sink) is large (or believed to be large) relative to most other GHG flux sources Trends in There is a documented increase or decrease in the size of the source over time magnitude or a projected trend based on projected changes in agricultural practices Uncertainty of The uncertainty of the GHG fluxes is (or is believed to be) large GHG flux estimates Degree of There are potential emissions reductions that could be undertaken or control influenced by the reporting company Risk The source contributes to the company\u2019s risk exposure (e.g., climate change related risks such as financial, regulatory, supply chain, product and customer, litigation, and reputational risks) Stakeholders The source is deemed critical by key stakeholders (e.g., customers, suppliers, investors or civil society) Sector Guidance The source has been identified as significant by sector-specific guidance Other The source meets any additional criteria developed by the company or sector Identifying key sources based on the magnitude of GHG fluxes is preferred The most rigorous approach to identifying key sources is to use quantitative data to rank the size of different sources (and sinks). This approach has three steps: 1. Obtain GHG flux data. Preferentially, companies would use data from the latest available inventory, although certain sources will fluctuate in magnitude from one inventory period to another. Alternatively, companies may use initial GHG estimation (or screening) methods to estimate the fluxes for each source (e.g., by 50\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance using industry-average data, LCA studies of different food or biofuel products, or rough estimates). 2. Rank all sources from largest to smallest according to their estimated GHG fluxes. Removals should be listed as absolute values (i.e. no negative sign) to allow the proper identification of significant sinks. 3. Apply a pre-determined, percentage cumulative threshold. Key sources are then those that together add up to a certain percentage of the overall emissions (e.g., key sources are cumulatively responsible for 70% of GHG fluxes). Trends in magnitude are also useful for identifying key sources In addition to ranking sources for a given inventory period, it may also be useful to rank sources based on the percentage change in fluxes over time (e.g., between the base period and the latest inventory period), if data are available.

Trends in magnitude are also useful for identifying key sources In addition to ranking sources for a given inventory period, it may also be useful to rank sources based on the percentage change in fluxes over time (e.g., between the base period and the latest inventory period), if data are available. Percentage change in GHG flux latest inventory estimate(cid:3398)base period estimate (cid:3404) (cid:1876)100% absolute value of base period estimate This analysis is helpful because it can identify sources whose trend is different from that of the overall inventory. Companies may choose not to invest additional resources in estimating emissions that show a declining trend (or sequestration that shows an increasing trend), especially if these trends result from the introduction of mitigation measures. However, prioritizing these sources is still recommended to help ensure inventories reflect mitigation efforts as much as possible. Companies may likewise chose to invest more in categories whose fluxes show large increases. Companies should not exclude small or highly uncertain emissions sources In general, companies should not exclude required emissions sources from their inventories as a result of uncertainty. Instead, to ensure the relevance and completeness of the inventory, companies may decide to use a less accurate approach for emissions sources that are expected to be relatively less significant, as long as the inventory is transparent about the limitations of the calculation approaches used (see Chapter 9). For instance, while fuel use will often comprise a small share of the inventory of a ranching operation, it should still be included in the inventory, but may be estimated based on simplified assumptions. Can \u2018materiality thresholds\u2019 be used? These are minimum GHG accounting thresholds that state that when a given source is smaller than the threshold size it can be omitted from the inventory. Although it appears useful in theory, the practical implementation of such a threshold is not compatible with the completeness principle of this Guidance. In order to use a materiality threshold, the emissions from a particular source or activity would have to be quantified to ensure they were under the threshold. However, once emissions are quantified, most of the benefit of having a threshold is lost. 51\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 7.3 Selecting a calculation approach GHG fluxes can be determined in different ways, ranging from the use of highly specialized, field-scale measurement equipment to global emission factors. This Guidance does not require or recommend the use of a specific calculation approach or tool. Instead companies should select an approach that best meets their objectives for compiling an inventory and that meets the GHG accounting and reporting principles (see Chapter 3 and below). The distinction between mechanical and non-mechanical sources becomes paramount when calculating GHG fluxes and the associated levels of uncertainty. In general, GHG fluxes for mechanical sources can be calculated with higher accuracy. This is especially true of mobile and stationary sources, whose emissions are primarily of CO and can be 2 calculated based on only a few items of information \u2013 mostly the type and amount of fuel used. In contrast, the GHG fluxes to/from non-mechanical sources depend on complex interactions between management practices and variable environmental conditions. As a result, GHG flux data for these sources are likely to have much higher uncertainty, regardless of the calculation approach chosen. This difference has important implications for how these data should be reported in inventories (see Chapter 9). Because calculation tools for mechanical tools are widely available (e.g., from GHG reporting programs), this section will focus on non-mechanical sources. How are GHG fluxes calculated for non-mechanical sources? Broadly, four different types of calculation approaches can be used for non-mechanical sources (Table 7-4): \uf0b7 Field measurements \uf0b7 Emission factors \uf0b7 Empirical models and process-based models Field measurements Many, but not all, GHG emission sources in agriculture can be measured using either direct or indirect measurement techniques. Direct techniques include controlled livestock chambers that measure the CH emissions from enteric fermentation, flux chambers that 4 measure the N O and CO emissions from plots of land, and gas flux meters that measure 2 2 the CH emissions from certain livestock waste management systems (e.g., covered 4 anaerobic lagoons). Indirect techniques include the measurement of carbon stocks before and after a change in management practices or land use. Indirect techniques are often much simpler and easier, but may require additional planning ahead of time to capture the \u2018before\u2019 scenario. While useful for research, both direct and indirect techniques are often far too costly for developing corporate inventories. Emission factors The simplest approach involves the multiplication of management activity data by a relevant emission factor, which is a coefficient describing the amount of GHG flux per 52\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance unit of activity. For instance, to calculate the CH emissions from enteric fermentation, ", "embedding_index": 21}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_22", "text": " often much simpler and easier, but may require additional planning ahead of time to capture the \u2018before\u2019 scenario. While useful for research, both direct and indirect techniques are often far too costly for developing corporate inventories. Emission factors The simplest approach involves the multiplication of management activity data by a relevant emission factor, which is a coefficient describing the amount of GHG flux per 52\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance unit of activity. For instance, to calculate the CH emissions from enteric fermentation, 4 emissions may be estimated by multiplying the number of dairy cattle by an emission factor that specifies how much CH is emitted per head of dairy cattle. The accuracy of 4 this approach depends not only on the accuracy of the activity data, but also on how specific the factor is to the specific combination of environmental factors and management activities concerned. Default emission factors are largely either based on field measurements at individual research sites or represent average values across a range of sites. Empirical and process-based models Empirical models use field measurements to develop statistical relationships between GHG fluxes and agricultural management factors. In turn, process-based (or mechanistic) models mathematically link important biogeochemical processes that control the production, consumption, and emission of GHGs. Some models may only require one or several inputs to estimate GHG fluxes; others might have extensive data requirements that span different spatial and temporal scales. Input data can be physical variables such as temperature, precipitation, elevation, and soil nutrient levels, or biological variables such as soil microbial activity and plant diversity. The accuracy of models is variable and depends on the robustness of the model and the accuracy of the inputs. For instance, if a model is used in a new agro-climate regime for which it was not previously calibrated, the model may not be reliable. GHG fluxes can also be calculated using any combination of the above approaches. For instance, empirical or process models could be used to derive more specific emission factors. The resulting hybrid approaches can increase the accuracy and practicability of calculating emissions. No one approach is ideal The calculation approaches differ in how they map onto the various tiers defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the purposes of national inventory reporting (see Box 7-1). In general, emission factors and empirical models (IPCC Tiers 1 and 2) are the easiest and least resource-intensive approaches to use. But they are not very effective in capturing the geographical variation in the biophysical processes that underpin GHG fluxes and they may not be sensitive to many changes in farm management practices. As a result, they tend to become less accurate as spatial resolution increases from a regional or national level to a local or farm-level. And their use may mask much of the variation in performance that exists amongst farms. Emission factors and empirical models also tend to focus on individual emission sources and management practices one at a time. This is a problem because non-mechanical sources are often connected by complex flows of N and C through farms, such that management activities have non-additive GHG effects. For example, soil N O emissions 2 are affected not only by fertilizer application regimes, but also by tillage, soil pH management, irrigation, and drainage practices. As a result, the GHG impact of different agricultural practices is best evaluated simultaneously and at the whole farm-level. 53\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance In contrast to emission factors and empirical models, field measurements (Tier 3) and process models (IPCC Tiers 2 and 3) integrate and link multiple sources, allowing a whole farm analysis of GHG fluxes. They are therefore particularly suited to understanding trade-offs in the emissions of different GHGs (see Box 7-2). However, the use of field measurements and process models can require expertise, data and time that will often not be available. Companies may choose to use different approaches for different activities. Box 7-1. IPCC Methodologies for National GHG Emissions Inventories The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a comprehensive set of methodologies - the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories* - to guide the preparation of national inventories. Many of the tools listed in Appendix III rely on some portion of these Guidelines, especially the default emission factors and calculation formulae. The Guidelines define three general tiers of methodologies based on their complexity and data requirements. The choice of tier depends, in part, on the significance of the emissions sources under consideration. \uf0b7 Tier 1: Simple, emission factor-based approach. Tier 1 emission factors are international defaults, although they will often have been based on studies conducted in a select few (mostly temperate) countries. \uf0b7 Tier 2: More region-specific emission factors or more refined empirical estimation methodologies. \uf0b7 Tier 3: Dynamic bio-geophysical simulation models using multi-year time", "embedding_index": 22}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_23", "text": " data requirements.

GHG trade-offs and the value of a whole-farm approach to calculating GHG fluxes Mitigation options or best management practices (BMPs) introduced to reduce the emissions of one GHG can sometimes increase those of others. Some examples include: \uf0b7 Measures taken to enhance soil C sequestration (e.g., no till-practices, the recovery of degraded pasture, or increased irrigation) can increase soil N O 2 emissions because of increased soil moisture content, a supply of easily mineralizable N, and/or reduced soil aeration. \uf0b7 Wooded riparian buffer zones can increase C sequestration but lead to increased soil N O emissions, compared to field margins. 2 \uf0b7 Constructed wetlands can sequester C over long time periods, but can also emit CH . 4 \uf0b7 Aerating a manure lagoon to reduce CH emissions will increase N O emissions. 4 2 \uf0b7 Removal of straw from flooded rice paddies to reduce CH emissions can lead to 4 the requirement for more fertilizer and increased N O emissions. 2 \uf0b7 Leaving sugarcane residue on fields can increase soil C sequestration but also increase CH emissions. 4 \uf0b7 The winter use of restricted grazing systems and stand-off pads \u2013 purpose built, drained resting surfaces to hold livestock over wet periods \u2013 to reduce soil N O 2 emissions and N leaching can increase CH emissions. 4 \uf0b7 The application of N-transformation inhibitors to soils", "embedding_index": 23}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_24", "text": " emissions can lead to 4 the requirement for more fertilizer and increased N O emissions. 2 \uf0b7 Leaving sugarcane residue on fields can increase soil C sequestration but also increase CH emissions. 4 \uf0b7 The winter use of restricted grazing systems and stand-off pads \u2013 purpose built, drained resting surfaces to hold livestock over wet periods \u2013 to reduce soil N O 2 emissions and N leaching can increase CH emissions. 4 \uf0b7 The application of N-transformation inhibitors to soils to reduce the leaching of some N O precursors may increase that of others. 2 These examples demonstrate the need to identify trade-offs and consider multiple emissions sources and GHGs in tandem when evaluating possible mitigation measures. A whole-systems approach avoids potentially ill-advised practices based on preoccupation with one individual GHG or practice. What tools are available for calculating GHG fluxes? There are an increasing number of publicly available tools - spreadsheets, software and protocols - for calculating GHG fluxes based on emission factors, models or a combination of these approaches. Appendix III provides a non-exhaustive list of such tools. Most of the more accessible and user-friendly tools that would be most amenable to use by farm managers tend to implement Tier 1 or Tier 2 approaches. Unfortunately, process-oriented models are often unwieldy to use, although more user-friendly interfaces are available or under construction for some process models and specifically intended for use by farm managers, extension agents, and consultants. These offer the most potential for accurately calculating farm-level GHG fluxes, at least in regions for which background, calibrating datasets are available. Tools should be evaluated against a range of criteria This Guidance does not recommend specific tools for calculating GHG fluxes \u2013 companies should instead select tools that best allow them to meet their objectives for 56\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance compiling an inventory and the GHG accounting and reporting principles. In evaluating individual tools, companies should consider a range of questions, including: \uf0b7 Is the tool comprehensive in terms of its coverage of different emission sources, GHGs and management activities, particularly those that are practiced or planned on the farm? And does it integrate the effects of multiple management activities across the farm? \uf0b7 What input data are required and will farm managers be able to provide these data? \uf0b7 How much labor and technical expertise is required to use the tool? \uf0b7 Is the tool transparent about its methodology, including limitations and assumptions? \uf0b7 Is the tool geographically representative? Is it tailored to the region/area of interest? \uf0b7 Is the tool accurate enough to help meet the business objectives for compiling an inventory? \uf0b7 Is the tool up-to-date (e.g., are emissions factors updated on an annual basis)? \uf0b7 Does the tool provide estimates of uncertainty? \uf0b7 Does the tool have verifications functions (e.g., are ranges enforced for the values of activity data)? \uf0b7 Can the tool quantify environmental impacts other than GHG fluxes (e.g., nitrate or phosphorus pollution)? \uf0b7 Can the tool quantify GHG performance metrics? \uf0b7 Is the tool otherwise consistent with the GHG accounting principles? Figure 7-2 outlines a decision tree for choosing a tool based on core questions. 57\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Figure 7-2. Decision tree for choosing a GHG emissions calculation tool. 7.4 Uncertainty in activity and GHG flux data The GHG fluxes to/from agricultural sources \u2013 and especially non-mechanical sources - are inevitably estimated with some degree of uncertainty. Identifying sources of uncertainty can help companies understand the steps required to improve the inventory quality and the level of confidence users should have in both the inventory results and any estimates of emissions reductions from changes in farming practices. Two types of uncertainty affect GHG flux estimations 1.Model uncertainty. This refers to intrinsic limitations in the ability of the calculation approach to reflect real world conditions. Such uncertainty is particularly important for non-mechanical sources whose GHG fluxes are often determined by complex interactions between biological processes (e.g., nitrification and decomposition), environmental factors (e.g., temperature, rainfall, soil pH), and management practices. Failure to reflect these interactions accurately in the calculation approach can lead to significant divergence between actual and calculated values. For some sources it may not be possible to improve accuracy until science has refined the calculation approach (i.e. until the model uncertainty has been reduced to an acceptable level). 58\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 2.Parameter uncertainty. This is a measure of how close the data used to calculate the inventory results (e.g., activity data and emission factors) are to the true (though unknown) actual data and GHG fluxes. Parameter uncertainties can be evaluated through statistical analysis, measurement equipment, precision determinations, and expert judgment. Together, these sources of uncertainty affect whether GHG data are accurate enough to meet the business goals that are", "embedding_index": 24}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_25", "text": " to an acceptable level). 58\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 2.Parameter uncertainty. This is a measure of how close the data used to calculate the inventory results (e.g., activity data and emission factors) are to the true (though unknown) actual data and GHG fluxes. Parameter uncertainties can be evaluated through statistical analysis, measurement equipment, precision determinations, and expert judgment. Together, these sources of uncertainty affect whether GHG data are accurate enough to meet the business goals that are driving inventory development or to determine if changes in GHG fluxes are the result of management changes. Companies should focus on parameter uncertainty In general, understanding parameter uncertainty will be the primary focus of companies in managing inventory quality. This is because most companies will lack the technical capacity to estimate model uncertainty, while most companies should be able to estimate parameter uncertainty. As far as is possible, companies should identify and track key uncertainty sources throughout the inventory process and iteratively check whether the uncertainty of the results is adequate for the company\u2019s business goals. The GHG Protocol does not define acceptable uncertainty levels. However, if the uncertainty bounds are asymmetrical, the larger uncertainty should be used to remain conservative. Parameter uncertainty can be quantified based on one or more the following: \u2022 Measured uncertainty (represented by standard deviations) \u2022 The pedigree matrix approach, based on data quality indicators (DQIs)8 \u2022 Default uncertainties for specific activities or sector data (reported in various literature) \u2022 Probability distributions from commercial databases \u2022 Uncertainty factors reported in literature \u2022 Other approaches reported by literature Uncertainty data for emission factors will often be available. For instance, the IPCC typically provides uncertainty bounds for its Tier 1 emission factors. The GHG Protocol\u2019s Quantitative Inventory Uncertainty tool9 provides more information on assessing the overall uncertainty of an inventory and the contribution of each data element to this uncertainty. Information on uncertainty should be reported Uncertainty can be reported in many ways, including through qualitative descriptions of uncertainty sources, and quantitative representations, such as error bars, histograms, probability density functions, etc. It is useful to provide as complete a disclosure of uncertainty information as is possible. Users of the information may then weigh the total set of information provided in judging their confidence in the information. 8 The use of DQIs involves rating individual data points against a range of quality criteria, such as precision and geographical representativeness. 9 http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools 59\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Chapter 8: Accounting for Carbon Stocks Agricultural systems contain C in above-ground and below-ground biomass, dead organic matter (DOM), soil organic matter, and harvested products (Chapter 4.2). These C stocks are reversible - any C sequestered in C stocks will eventually be emitted to the atmosphere. Also, changes in C stocks can take decades to reach equilibrium following a change in farm management or land use. These special features of agriculture have important implications for whether and how C stocks should be included within GHG inventories. This chapter: \uf0d8 Describes how changes in C stocks should be reported in terms of CO fluxes. 2 \uf0d8 Describes the types of CO fluxes that should / should not be included in 2 inventories. \uf0d8 Describes how the CO fluxes from long-term changes in C stocks can be spread 2 over multiple reporting periods. Summary of requirements and main recommendations: \uf0d8 Companies should report the net CO fluxes (in tonnes CO ) to/from organic C 2 2 stocks in mineral/organic soils and above-ground and below-ground woody biomass, as well as the CO emissions from DOM and biomass combustion. 2 \uf0d8 Natural disturbances, Payments for Environmental Services (PESs), and conservation areas should be accounted for equivalently to other agricultural activities. \uf0d8 Companies should use peer-reviewed methods for CO flux calculations. 2 \uf0d8 When relevant, companies should amortize changes in C stocks evenly over time using a fixed-rate approach. \uf0d8 Companies should account for historical changes in land use or management occurring on or after the base period. 8.1 Including flux and stock data in inventories Companies should report net CO flux data 2 Because of the reversibility of C stocks, changes to C stocks can be quantified using data on: \uf0b7 Stock size, when measured in units of mass of C (e.g., metric tonnes C/ha) at two points in time; or \uf0b7 The net balance of CO emissions and CO removals (\u2018net fluxes\u2019) to or from a 2 2 stock, measured in units of mass of CO . 2 Both approaches are equally valid. Under either, companies should take care to use methods that treat soil depth consistently, particularly in the context of LUC. For instance, reference stock values might be available for soil C stocks in forest and 60\n\nGHG", "embedding_index": 25}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_26", "text": " C/ha) at two points in time; or \uf0b7 The net balance of CO emissions and CO removals (\u2018net fluxes\u2019) to or from a 2 2 stock, measured in units of mass of CO . 2 Both approaches are equally valid. Under either, companies should take care to use methods that treat soil depth consistently, particularly in the context of LUC. For instance, reference stock values might be available for soil C stocks in forest and 60\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance cropland - if these are not defined to a consistent depth10, some of the estimated stock difference will reflect methodological differences rather than actual variation. While companies should report net CO flux data, they may also report data on stock size 2 (when available) to provide useful context for interpreting inventory results. Stock size (cid:2872)(cid:2872) data can be converted to net flux data by multiplying the mass of stock change by , (cid:2869)(cid:2870) which is the ratio of the molecular weights of CO and elemental carbon. 2 Companies should use peer-reviewed methods for CO flux calculations 2 This Guidance does not prescribe specific methodologies for calculating the CO fluxes 2 to/from C stocks. Any of the general approaches detailed in Chapter 7.3 may be used, as long as the underlying methodology has been scientifically vetted (i.e., has undergone peer review). Appendix III lists many, scientifically published and well established calculation tools for estimating CO fluxes. 2 8.2 Reporting recommendations for different C stocks Recommended CO fluxes 2 The following CO fluxes should be included in inventories: 2 1. CO emissions from, and atmospheric removals by, organic C stocks in mineral and 2 organic soils 2. CO emissions from, and atmospheric removals by, below-ground and above-ground 2 woody biomass (e.g., woody vegetation in orchards, vineyards and agroforestry systems) 3. CO emissions from the combustion of herbaceous biomass (e.g., open burning of 2 crop residues) 4. CO emissions from DOM 2 These fluxes should be reported within a special \u2018Biogenic Carbon\u2019 category that is outside of the scopes. The one exception concerns the CO emissions from soils and 2 woody biomass that result from LUC. These LUC CO emissions should be reported 2 within the scopes because they effectively constitute permanent losses of C to the atmosphere (see Chapter 9.1). The CH and N O emissions from all C stocks (e.g., from biomass or DOM combustion) 4 2 shall always be reported in the scopes. Additional CO fluxes that may be reported 2 1. Fluxes to/from inorganic soil carbon stocks 10 This Guidance does not recommend a minimum soil depth for measuring soil C stocks. 61\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance In contrast to soil organic C stocks, inorganic C stocks are slow to respond to management changes and often will not exhibit significant changes. Moreover, quantifying such changes requires a detailed understanding of site hydrology and mineralogy. For instance, it may require following the fate of discharged dissolved inorganic C and base cations (e.g., Ca and Mg) from the managed land, at least until they are fully captured in the oceanic inorganic C cycle. Such analyses are highly complicated. For these reasons, companies can exclude the net fluxes to/from inorganic soil C stocks. However, certain management practices can be expected to significantly affect inorganic C stocks by changing soil chemistry and inducing the breakdown of carbonates, leading to CO emissions. For instance, use of ammonium sulfate fertilizer to lower soil pH will 2 tend to promote CO emissions from inorganic C. In such cases, companies should 2 consider quantifying the CO emissions. 2 2. Sequestration in organic soils. In wetland environments with organic soils, the rates of C sequestration are relatively slow and can be assumed to be negligible. They therefore can be excluded. CO fluxes that should not be reported 2 1. Sequestration in harvested woody products (HWPs) and herbaceous vegetation The C contained in HWPs should not be included in any reported values for the amount of sequestration in above-ground woody biomass stocks. Depending on how these values have been calculated, this may mean that the amount of C in HWPs will have to be subtracted from estimates of the total amount of sequestration. This subtraction is necessary to ensure that inventories do not over-estimate the net GHG benefits of woody crop production. The biomass associated with annual and perennial herbaceous vegetation is relatively ephemeral - reductions in these biomass stocks from harvesting, the burning of the crop residues, or the integration of crop residues into soils, are balanced by stock increases from plant re-growth over a", "embedding_index": 26}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_27", "text": " the amount of C in HWPs will have to be subtracted from estimates of the total amount of sequestration. This subtraction is necessary to ensure that inventories do not over-estimate the net GHG benefits of woody crop production. The biomass associated with annual and perennial herbaceous vegetation is relatively ephemeral - reductions in these biomass stocks from harvesting, the burning of the crop residues, or the integration of crop residues into soils, are balanced by stock increases from plant re-growth over a period of only one to a few years. Consequently, companies should also not report any sequestration in herbaceous biomass stocks. 2. CO fluxes to/from livestock 2 The carbon incorporated into animal tissues or lost through animal respiration should not be reported in an inventory. Special note: Accounting for natural disturbances, conservation areas, and payments for environmental services Natural disturbances are varied and include fires, windstorms, landslides, droughts, and pest outbreaks. Conservation areas are lands where agricultural production has been limited or halted so as to provide environmental benefits, such as maintaining or 62\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance improving water quality or wildlife habitat. Such areas may be established mandatorily, to meet legal requirements for resource protection, or voluntarily, to contribute to the public good and/or take advantage of financial incentives. Payments for Environmental Services (PESs) are incentives offered to farmers or landowners in exchange for managing their land to provide some sort of ecological service. Box 8-1 shows some examples of conservation areas and PESs. Box 8-1. Examples of conservation areas and PESs in agriculture Conservation easements: A legal agreement voluntarily entered into by a property owner and a qualified conservation organization such as a Natural disturbances, conservation areas, and PESs are treated identically to other sources and activities The CO fluxes associated with natural disturbances, conservation areas and PESs should 2 be treated the same way as other CO fluxes, following the recommendations outlined 2 above. The reason is that companies often have some measure of control over these fluxes - they are often be able to influence the frequency or intensity of disturbances and the corresponding amount of emissions, while operational decisions frequently lead directly to the formation of conservation areas. For instance, many forest management practices can reduce the risk of disturbances - forest thinning can increase resilience to 63\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance droughts and insect/diseases outbreaks, while fuel hazard reduction and the use of prescribed fires can reduce the risk of uncontrolled fires. Another reason for not excluding natural disturbances is that it is often challenging to identify whether an event actually constitutes a disturbance. For instance, there are no universally accepted criteria for defining droughts. GHG fluxes attributable to disturbances may also be reported in a separate line item Companies may separately estimate the amount of GHG fluxes that they consider attributable to natural disturbances and report this amount outside of the scopes in a line item that is separate from the scopes and the Biogenic Carbon category. This reporting is additional to the reporting of these same fluxes within the scopes or the Biogenic Carbon category. Estimating the specific GHG effects of individual disturbances is challenging because: 1. Ambiguity often exists around whether an event is a \u2018disturbance\u2019 or simply within the bounds of \u2018normal\u2019 environmental variation. Companies might therefore have to establish criteria for consistently recognizing disturbances. 2. Natural disturbances may be rare events, in which case the effects on estimated CO fluxes may be small when averaged over large areas or long periods of time 2 and therefore difficult to accurately quantify. For instance, the effects of a one- year period of insect defoliation might be difficult to distinguish from background fluxes over a three-year period. In contrast, catastrophic disturbances such as wind storms may cause obvious and easily estimated changes in C stocks. Because of these challenges, companies should evaluate the likely size of a disturbance before committing the resources to quantifying it. For the sake of practicality, if companies do choose to report disturbance emissions, they may assume that all post- disturbance emissions occur in the year of the disturbance event. That is, the CO 2 emissions from the long-term decay of DOM created during an event (e.g., downed trees from a windstorm) can be reported in the year of the event. Alternatively, these emissions can be amortized (see Chapter 8.3). 8.3 Amortizing changes in carbon stocks over time What is \u2018amortizing\u2019 and when is it necessary? Shifts in management practices during the reporting period will often have long-lasting effects on C stocks that may persist for decades. For instance, following a change in management practices (e.g., adoption of no-till practices) soil C stocks may take 15 - 60 years to reach equilibrium, depending on the type of tillage and crop rotation regimes. Following LUC (e.g.,", "embedding_index": 27}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_28", "text": " Amortizing changes in carbon stocks over time What is \u2018amortizing\u2019 and when is it necessary? Shifts in management practices during the reporting period will often have long-lasting effects on C stocks that may persist for decades. For instance, following a change in management practices (e.g., adoption of no-till practices) soil C stocks may take 15 - 60 years to reach equilibrium, depending on the type of tillage and crop rotation regimes. Following LUC (e.g., conversion of cropland to grassland), the transition period will often exceed 100 years (e.g., Figure 8-1). Also, as Figure 8-1 demonstrates, the rate of change in C stocks will vary over time. Amortizing the CO fluxes from changes in C 2 stocks involves allocating these fluxes across time (and therefore multiple inventories) to ensure the more consistent accounting of C stock impacts. 64\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Figure 8-1. Illustration of land use change between grassland and cropland Source: To be provided Whether amortization is needed depends on the calculation approach As discussed in Chapter 7.3, a variety of methods can be used to quantify CO fluxes. If a 2 method is used that directly estimates the amount of GHG flux (or stock change) within the reporting period, amortization is not needed. Conversely, if the estimated data are generated for the transition period as a whole, rather than just for the reporting period, amortization is needed (Table 8-1). Table 8-1. Examples of calculation approaches that will and will not require amortization of the calculated CO fluxes. 2 Calculation approach Examples Is amortization required?

These are: \uf0b7 The CO emissions from biomass and DOM combustion 2 \uf0b7 The CO emissions from the organic carbon stocks of organic soils. 2 Amortizing the CO emissions from DOM stocks is optional 2 Some management practices may move C to DOM stocks that is not then emitted in the year of the intervention. For instance, much of the C in biomass killed in a fire is added to dead wood, litter and soil pools from where the C will be emitted over years to decades, as the DOM decomposes. Quantifying the emissions from these DOM stock changes can be very challenging; for instance, DOM decay rates differ greatly between regions, depending on temperature and moisture regimes. Consequently, companies may either assume that the total CO emissions from DOM stocks occur in the year of the 2 intervention, or, should capacity and data exist, they may amortize these emissions over time. Table 8-2 summarizes when it is and is not appropriate to amortize CO fluxes. 2 Table 8-2.

This involves 2 dividing the total flux by the number of years in the amortization period and then reporting the quotient in each year of the amortization period. This approach is recommended because it provides the most consistent way to distribute impacts for use in a GHG inventory. The length of the amortization period is context specific The length of the amortization period may vary depending on the stock concerned and the quantification approach. In general, the amortization period for any one stock should be: \uf0b7 The length of the time dependence of the stock change factor or emission factor; or \uf0b7 For woody biomass stocks, the length of the nominal harvest/maturity cycle. The second condition assumes that woody vegetation accumulates biomass for a finite period until it is removed through harvest or reaches a steady state where there is no net accumulation of C in biomass because growth rates have slowed and incremental gains from growth are offset by losses from natural mortality, pruning or other losses. In the absence of other information, companies may assume an amortization period of 20 years for DOM stocks and the organic C stocks in mineral soils. This 20-year value is the default time horizon in national GHG inventories submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 11. This value may be too long for certain stocks (e.g., soil stock changes in tropical biomes) and too short for others (soil stock changes in boreal biomes). Companies may alternatively assume more specific values used by individual countries in their national inventories12. Companies should account for historical LUC Companies should account for historical changes in land use that occur within a certain \u2018look back\u2019 period prior to the base period. This look back period should be equal in length to the amortization period for the stock concerned (e.g., 20 years if the default IPCC amortization period for mineral soil organic stocks is used). Thus, if LUC happened within the 5 years preceding the base period, it is considered best practice to reflect it in the inventories for the base period and later reporting periods, as needed. Equivalently, if the shift occurred more than 20 years before the base period, it should not be reflected in the base period inventory. As discussed in Chapter 6.2, the acquisition (or divestment) of business units that own land can trigger base period recalculations. C stocks may be changing on the newly- transferred land as a result of land use changes introduced by the prior land-owner. 11 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 4. 12 See http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_ghg_inventories/items/2715.php. 67\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Therefore, when recalculating the base period inventory, new landowners should assess whether these changes occurred within the relevant look back period from their base periods. If so, the associated changes in C stocks should be included in the recalculated base year inventory. For instance, if a company acquired land that had been deforested by the prior land-owner five years before the new land-owner\u2019s base period, the associated changes in C stocks should be included in the recalculated base period inventory. Appendix II provides an example. Proxy data on historical LUC should be used in the absence of actual data Companies, and especially new landowners, may find it difficult to obtain information on historical LUC. What should they do in such cases? This Guidance recommends that companies identify and estimate historical LUC using regional or local trends in, for example, land clearance. Alternatively, remote sensing data may be available from commercial or public databases, although the collection of such data can be time consuming and complicated. Additional reporting recommendations 1. To maintain the transparency of reported data, companies should report when they have not been able to collect historical data and estimate historical effects. 2. Companies should carefully document all assumptions made in amortizing CO 2 fluxes (see Chapter 9.1). This is because the amortization schedule chosen by a company will not match actual patterns of change, and a given period\u2019s inventory will most likely under- or over-estimate the actual fluxes (for instance, see Fig. 8- 2). 3. If management shifts occur", "embedding_index": 29}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_30", "text": " report when they have not been able to collect historical data and estimate historical effects. 2.

This is because the amortization schedule chosen by a company will not match actual patterns of change, and a given period\u2019s inventory will most likely under- or over-estimate the actual fluxes (for instance, see Fig. 8- 2). 3. If management shifts occur that would reverse any soil C sequestration that has previously been amortized, companies should account for these losses in the inventory period in which the shift occurred. For instance, if no till practices were to cease at any point and be replaced by conventional till, C sequestration will be rapidly lost, and companies should record the cumulative gains up to that point as CO emissions in the inventory period in which conventional till started. 2 Appendix II provides simplified case studies that illustrate how amortization is carried out, including for historical LUC. 68\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Figure 8-2. Amortization schedules chosen by companies will not match actual patterns of change. In this example C sequesters in soil at a non-linear rate following the adoption of reduced-tillage. But the CO emissions are amortized at a fixed rate, causing actual 2 fluxes to be either under- or over-estimated in any one reporting period. Note that the sequestration rates rise due to reduced soil disturbance but slow down as the C stock becomes saturated due to inherent physiochemical processes. 69\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Chapter 9: Reporting GHG Data Fundamentally, a credible inventory provides information that is complete, accurate, consistent and transparent, while meeting the decision-making needs of both internal management and external stakeholders. This chapter: \uf0d8 Describes information that must be reported in an inventory. \uf0d8 Outlines additional, sector-specific recommendations for reporting agricultural GHG fluxes. \uf0d8 Provides guidance on reporting offset and renewable energy projects on farms.

Defining land-use change To determine when LUC has occurred and to ensure LUC impacts are accounted for consistently across inventories, companies should use a consistent set of definitions for land use categories over time. Currently, there is no single internationally accepted standard for land use classification \u2013 different countries and international organizations have developed their own sets of definitions. Companies may find it simpler to use a country-specific classification system should their operations occur within a single country. Companies with agricultural operations in multiple countries may instead find it 72\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance easier to use internationally recognized classification systems (e.g., the EU\u2019s CORINE system). A simplified set of land use categories is shown below. LUC occurs when land is converted from one land use category to another13; for instance, when cropland is converted to grassland or when forests are converted to cropland. On occasion, the same area of land might be used to support multiple agricultural activities and so meet the definitions for different land-use categories. For instance, savannah woodland might be used both to graze livestock and as a source of wood fuel. In such cases, companies should categorize the land based on the agricultural activity that is economically most important. Land use Definition category Forest land An area of high concentration of woody biomass. Typically defined on the basis of a minimum tree height and canopy cover. Forests lands include plantations, primary forests, and naturally regenerated forests with evidence of human intervention Cropland Includes rice fields and agro-forestry systems. Grassland Managed grasslands, rangelands, pasture land. Wetland Areas of peat extraction and land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the year (e.g., peatlands) and that does not fall into other categories. Settlements All developed land (e.g., roads, buildings, etc.). 9.3 Additional information that may be reported Besides the required and best practice reporting elements, companies may wish to report other information to enhance the transparency and relevance of their inventories. This information includes: \uf0b7 Data on the size of C stocks (in metric tonnes C per unit land area) \uf0b7 Biogenic CO flux data further subdivided by the type of C stock (e.g., DOM versus 2 biomass stocks) \uf0b7 Other GHG flux data further subdivided", "embedding_index": 31}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_32", "text": ", etc.). 9.3 Additional information that may be reported Besides the required and best practice reporting elements, companies may wish to report other information to enhance the transparency and relevance of their inventories.

Land-based approaches assess the net emissions of select land-use categories while activity-based approaches assess the net emissions of select land-use activities. Both approaches can be used for developing national GHG inventories for the UNFCCC. 73\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance \uf0b7 Emissions of other GHGs (e.g., those of CFCs) \uf0b7 Performance metrics and a description of any allocation approach used in deriving these (see Appendix I) \uf0b7 A description of performance measured against internal or external benchmarks \uf0b7 An outline of current management practices and any GHG management strategies \uf0b7 GHG flux data for relevant scope 3 sources for which reliable data can be obtained \uf0b7 Information on the uncertainty of GHG flux data The reporting of scope 3 sources is optional, but encouraged Scope 3 sources are many and diverse. The Scope 3 Standard identifies 15 distinct categories. These include the activities of the reporting company\u2019s direct suppliers, cradle-to-gate impacts further upstream, as well as downstream activities, such as the customer use and disposal of products the company has manufactured and sold. Which scope 3 sources should be included in an inventory? Companies may either: 1. Report scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Corporate Standard (i.e. scope 3 sources are optional) 2. Report scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Scope 3 Standard For many companies, scope 3 emissions will represent a significant component of overall GHG impacts. For instance, the manufacture of fertilizer and livestock feed will be important scope 3 sources for crop and livestock operations, respectively. Moreover, companies may undertake some actions that reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions, but that then increase their scope 3 emissions (e.g., the outsourcing of feed production). For these reasons, specific scope 3 sources should be reported where those sources are considered significant. Criteria for assessing significance can include amounts of emissions, emissions reduction potential, contribution to risk exposure (e.g., regulatory or reputational risks), and importance to stakeholders. In general, the scope 3 emissions from fertilizer and feed production should be included in inventories, where possible. 9.4 Agricultural offset and renewable energy projects Companies can generate renewable energy in many ways, including: \uf0b7 Developing their own wind turbines or leasing land to wind power development firms \uf0b7 Growing trees, short rotation woodland and short rotation coppice as a source of biomass fuel stock \uf0b7 Installing anaerobic digesters to produce methane as fuel for electricity or heat \uf0b7 Developing farm-scale micro hydroelectricity schemes (typically less than ~ 100kW) \uf0b7 Using solar panels Such projects are a potential source of offset credits. Other offset projects could be based on the reforestation or restoration of degraded lands and changes in fertilizer management. 74\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Accounting for renewable energy projects The impact of many of these projects on a company\u2019s inventory will depend on whether any of the energy that is generated is consumed on-site by the company or sent to the grid. If the energy is consumed on-site, the project may reduce the amount of electricity or fuel consumed, resulting in a reduction in scope 1 or scope 2 emissions that will be evident when comparing inventories over time. On the other hand, if the energy is sent off-site, it shall not be used to lower scope 1 or scope 2 emissions. This is necessary to prevent double counting of the emissions benefits of that energy. This requirement extends to the calculation of performance metrics, which should not include the emissions benefits of sold energy. The GHG Protocol Guidelines for Grid-Connected Electricity Projects \u2013 a supplement to the Project Protocol (Chapter 1.2) - provide guidance on quantifying the emissions reductions from sold energy. Accounting for \u2018avoided\u2019 emissions Many renewable energy projects may have GHG impacts that extend beyond the farm gate \u2013 they may help to displace (or \u2018avoid\u2019) the emissions from fossil fuel-based electricity generation elsewhere on the grid that would have occurred in the absence of the project. Importantly, renewable energy generation projects do not always result in a physical reduction in emissions from fossil fuel consumption. For example: \uf0b7 On-site renewable energy that is sold to", "embedding_index": 32}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_33", "text": "ifying the emissions reductions from sold energy. Accounting for \u2018avoided\u2019 emissions Many renewable energy projects may have GHG impacts that extend beyond the farm gate \u2013 they may help to displace (or \u2018avoid\u2019) the emissions from fossil fuel-based electricity generation elsewhere on the grid that would have occurred in the absence of the project. Importantly, renewable energy generation projects do not always result in a physical reduction in emissions from fossil fuel consumption. For example: \uf0b7 On-site renewable energy that is sold to the grid: the total emissions of a fossil-fuel plant are affected by the aggregate demand of all consumers connected to the grid, such that the sale of renewable energy may be balanced by an increased demand for electricity amongst other grid consumers, with no net change in absolute emissions from the fossil-fuel plant. \uf0b7 Switching from residual fuel to wood waste produced on a farm: such switching may lead to emissions reductions from crude oil refining and waste fuel disposal, but whether these reductions are actually realized depends on the demand for fuel oil by other organizations. In these cases, the behavior of other consumers \u2013 which is outside of the control of the reporting company \u2013 means avoided emissions do not necessarily occur. As a result, avoided emissions shall not be reported within the scopes and they shall not be used to \u2018net\u2019 emissions14. However, estimates of avoided emissions may be reported as a memo item, as long as the underlying assumptions and appropriate calculation methodologies are also described. The Project Protocol provides guidance relevant for calculating avoided emissions. Accounting for transactions in offset credits Should a company sell an offset that has been generated within its organizational boundaries, it shall remove the associated emissions reductions from its corporate inventory to prevent double counting. It should also disclose the protocol used to verify the emissions reductions. 14 Avoided emissions are also not quantified as part of product life cycle inventories under the GHG Protocol Product Standard. 75\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Appendices 76\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Appendix I: Performance metrics The Corporate Standard and this Guidance only require the reporting of absolute GHG flux data. GHG performance metrics do not have to be reported. However, they can provide important insights into a company\u2019s GHG performance and are generally recommended as part of an effective GHG reporting and management system. For instance, they can be used to: \uf0b7 Evaluate performance over time (e.g., compare figures from different years, identify trends in data, and show performance in relation to targets and base periods). \uf0b7 Improve comparability between different sizes of operations by normalizing figures (e.g., by assessing the impact of differently sized operations on the same scale). This Appendix: \uf0b7 Summarizes the various types of GHG performance metrics that exist. \uf0b7 Provides general recommendations for the calculation, use, and reporting of metrics. Types and usage of performance metrics Many types of performance metrics exist Some examples of performance metrics are: Productivity and efficiency ratios: These express the value or achievement of a company divided by its GHG impact. Increasing efficiency ratios therefore reflect a positive performance improvement. Examples of productivity/efficiency ratios include resource productivity ratios (e.g., sales per GHG) and process eco-efficiency ratios (e.g., production volume per amount of GHG). Intensity ratios: Intensity (or \u2018normalized\u2019) ratios express GHG impact per unit of physical activity or unit of economic output. A physical intensity ratio is suitable when aggregating or comparing across businesses that have similar products. In turn, an economic intensity ratio is suitable when aggregating or comparing across businesses that produce different products. A declining intensity ratio reflects a positive performance improvement. Examples of intensity ratios include product intensity (e.g., tonnes of emissions per unit of sold livestock or crops generated) and sales intensity (e.g., emissions per sales). When calculating intensity ratios companies may have to allocate GHG fluxes amongst different product streams (see below). Percentages: A percentage indicator is a ratio between two similar variables (with the same physical unit in the numerator and the denominator). Examples of percentages that can be meaningful in performance reports include current GHG fluxes expressed as a percentage of base year GHG fluxes. In selecting a performance metric, companies should consider which metrics best capture the benefits and impacts of their business (e.g., its operations, its products, and its effects on the marketplace), as well as its intended application. 77\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance The use of multiple performance metrics is recommended Companies might find it useful to track performance using more than one metric. This is because individual metrics might exclude certain sources, such as those associated with by-products or co-products (see below) or those not directly connected to the production system. For the same reason, performance metrics should always be reported alongside data on the absolute GHG fluxes to/from a farm. The following scenarios show the importance of using additional ratio indicators (in addition to reporting absolute GHG flux data) to track performance", "embedding_index": 33}, {"chunk_id": "36e48f3b-8a2f-43c5-9c81-7607b8a919e0_34", "text": " is recommended Companies might find it useful to track performance using more than one metric. This is because individual metrics might exclude certain sources, such as those associated with by-products or co-products (see below) or those not directly connected to the production system. For the same reason, performance metrics should always be reported alongside data on the absolute GHG fluxes to/from a farm. The following scenarios show the importance of using additional ratio indicators (in addition to reporting absolute GHG flux data) to track performance at the whole farm level: \uf0b7 Production intensification (e.g., an increased use of fertilizers and/or feed) might boost yields and result in a net reduction in GHG intensity per unit of agricultural output (provided the inputs are not excessive), but could also increase emissions on a per hectare basis. \uf0b7 Increasing the feed conversion efficiency of cattle can reduce emissions per product, but can lead to greater overall emissions (and emissions per ha) if any spare feed is diverted to new livestock. Table I-1 describes various trade-offs associated with different types of metrics commonly used in the agricultural sector. Contextual information should be provided Importantly, the inherent diversity of agricultural practices, as well as the influence of environmental factors on GHG fluxes, will affect the comparability of metrics, both within and across businesses. For example: \uf0b7 Intensity ratios will often be higher for self-replacing livestock herds than non- replacement herds. This is because self-replacing herds contain younger stock that emit enteric CH and produce N O from urine depositions for a longer period of time 4 2 before contributing to farm products. \uf0b7 Adverse weather conditions can lower realized crop yields, causing inter-annual variation in intensity ratios, independent of any changes in farming practices. (Note: in such cases, companies may find it useful to normalize and report emissions by expected yield, in addition to actual yield). Without adequate context on the farming system, environmental effects, and the emissions sources that have been studied, performance metrics are not useful for assessing performance. Such context should be provided in reports to aid the reliable interpretation of performance metrics. 78\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Table I-1.

In addition, certain agricultural activities will contribute to multiple streams of products (and their co/by-products), especially on mixed farms (Figure I-1). For instance, fertilizer application will support not only crop growth, but also livestock production, if some of the primary output (the crop) is used as livestock feed. Allocation is the process of partitioning GHG flux data from a farm to the different product streams from that farm. Allocation may be needed when computing intensity ratios for individual products.

Allocations will not be necessary when a farm produces only one output. They should not be done to calculate the GHG fluxes that are to be reported in a corporate inventory, except to allocate between scope 1 and scope 3. Also, this Guidance is not concerned with allocations for product-level GHG accounting \u2013 for guidance on this topic, see the GHG Protocol Product Standard, sectoral life cycle accounting guidance, or product category rules. Should allocations be performed, note that co-products without economic value are considered wastes and should have no GHG fluxes allocated to them. Also, if GHG fluxes are allocated, they should sum to the total flux initially calculated. Figure I-1. Illustration of a common process requiring allocation Allocation should be avoided where possible If possible, companies should avoid allocation because allocation adds uncertainty to performance metrics. Companies may be able to avoid allocation in a number of ways: \uf0b7 By dividing the common GHG emitting process into sub-processes that separately produce the various products. This approach may be accomplished by subdividing the farm and providing data on the quantities of inputs going to each farm enterprise. Mechanical sources will often be the most difficult to allocate because farm records are often on a whole-farm basis. One possible solution may be to set up energy use accounting on a per product basis by, for example, sub-metering individual facilities and tracking fuel consumption or the number of field passes by field and date. \uf0b7 By redefining the scope of analysis for the performance metric so that the fluxes attributable to the various products no longer have to be separated. For instance, by expressing GHG emissions on a kg sheep-raised basis as opposed to a kg lamb meat basis, it is no longer necessary to separate out the emissions attributable to wool production. Different allocation approaches exist Should allocation be unavoidable, the following approaches may be used: 80\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Physical allocation: Allocations are based on an underlying physical relationship between the multiple inputs/outputs and the GHG fluxes. For example, if mass is the main causal factor driving differences between products, allocations can be based on the mass of farm outputs: Mass of specific product produced Allocated flux (cid:3404) (cid:3436) (cid:3440) x Total flux Total mass of all products produced Alternatively, physical allocations could be made based on the number or dietary quality of the products. The factor chosen should most accurately reflect the underlying physical relationship between the products and GHG fluxes. For example, if the mass of the outputs determines the amount of flux, choosing an energy content factor would not provide the most accurate allocation. Economic allocation: Allocations are based on the market value of each product leaving the process, as follows: Market Value of specific product produced Allocated flux (cid:3404) (cid:3436) (cid:3440) x Total flux Total market value of all products produced The market value of co-product(s) should be the value of the co-products as they leave the common process (i.e. prior to any further processing). Also, if prices for the outputs vary over the reporting period, it may be necessary to develop averages for the market values of the outputs over this period. Under either physical or economic allocation, co-products without economic value are considered wastes and should have no GHG fluxes allocated to them. Selecting an allocation approach A single approach should be used to consistently allocate the GHG data for all of the products of a farm. Otherwise, the use of multiple allocation methods might result in the over- or under- counting of total farm-wide fluxes. Different allocation methods can yield significantly different results. For example, in cheese manufacturing, cheese is considered the main product, while whey powder, whey butter and grated cheese are considered co-products. Under an economic allocation approach, the higher value of cheese compared with the co-products results in most of the GHG fluxes being attributed to the cheese. In contrast, under a physical allocation approach, the greater mass of the co-products would result in most of the GHG fluxes being attributed to the co-products. Companies should select the allocation approach that: \uf0b7 Best reflects the causal relationship between the production of the outputs and the resulting GHG fluxes; \uf0b7 Results in the most accurate and credible flux estimates; 81\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance \uf0b7 Best supports effective decision-making and GHG reduction activities; and \uf0b7 Otherwise adheres to the principles of relevance, accuracy, completeness, consistency and transparency.

Broadly, physical allocation is preferred when: \uf0b7 A physical relationship amongst the products can be established and this relationship drives their relative GHG impacts. \uf0b7 Prices change significantly or frequently over time. Example: fluctuation in commodity crop prices (note: averaging prices over three to five years can help avoid this problem). \uf0b7 Prices are not well-correlated with underlying physical properties and GHG fluxes. \uf0b7 Companies pay different prices for the same product (due to different negotiated prices). Economic allocation is preferred when: \uf0b7 A physical relationship amongst the products cannot be established or does not adequately reflect their GHG impacts. \uf0b7 The co-products were a waste output that acquires value in the market place as a replacement for another material input (e.g., manure as a replacement for fertilizer). 82\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Appendix II: Amortizing CO Fluxes to / from Carbon Stocks 2 Introduction Shifts in the management of farmland or the conversion of one land-use category into another can change C stocks over long time periods. Chapter 8 describes methodologies for accounting for the associated CO fluxes. Depending on how these fluxes have been calculated, they may 2 have to be amortized over a defined time period, with an equal amount of flux allocated to each year over that period. Consistent with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies, the length of this period can be assumed to be 20 years, unless more specific information is available (see Chapter 8.3). The amortization approach is illustrated here using a common land use pattern in central Brazil - the conversion of native vegetation (cerrado) into pasture and subsequently into an annual crop rotation (soybean-corn). Two cases are presented: \uf0b7 Case A: All soil stock changes are amortized before any further changes occur in the ownership or management of stocks \uf0b7 Case B: \uf0b7 Case C: Purchase of land undergoing changes in C stocks While these cases are hypothetical, they use representative data on soil C stocks that are derived from published studies. To facilitate ease of understanding, only soil C stocks are considered, while all fluxes are amortized before any further shifts occur in management practices. The management practices and land-use types considered, along with the corresponding C stocks, are shown in Table II-1. Table II-1. Soil C stocks of different management practices and land use types. 83\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Case A: All soil stock changes are amortized before any further changes occur in the ownership or management of stocks Cerrado is converted into a no-till crop system over the course of 75 years. While multiple shifts in land use and farming practices occur over this period, the resulting CO fluxes are fully 2 amortized before any further shifts occur. Table II-2 describes the time series of shifts in land use and management practices, as well as how the corresponding CO fluxes are amortized. GHG 2 emissions inventories are prepared annually. Figure II-1 shows how the C stocks change over time with amortization. Table II-2. The amortization schedule for case A Figure II-1: Changes in C stocks are fully amortized before any further shifts in management practices or management occur (Case A) 84\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Case B: Not all soil stock changes are amortized before a further change occurs in stock management Same as Case A, except that the pasture is converted into a full-till crop system only 10 years after the cerrado was first converted into pasture (i.e., when only half of the change in carbon stocks has been amortized). Table II-3 describes the time series of shifts in land use and management practices, as well as how the ensuing changes in carbon stocks are amortized. 85\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Table II-3. The amortization schedule for case B. Case C: Purchase of land undergoing changes in C stocks Same as Case A, but the land is acquired by the reporting company (at year 28) after its conversion into pasture (Figure II-2). The reporting company amortizes the CO fluxes from this 2 conversion over a 20 year period (ending year 25), but does not include all of these fluxes in its inventories. Instead, it only revises its inventories to report the CO fluxes that occurred during 2 years 20\u201325.

Three broad classes of tools are covered: \uf0b7 Tools suitable for farm managers. These are generally web- or Excel-based calculators that can be used with commonly available types of activity data. They tend to implement a variety of the calculation approaches described in Table 7-1; namely, emission factors, empirical or process models, or some combination of these approaches. \uf0b7 General catalogues of calculation methodologies. These describe formulae and default emission factors that can be used to calculate flux data for an extensive range of emissions sources. They do not provide an interface for performing calculations. \uf0b7 Tools suitable for academic use. These are primarily process-based models intended for academic research. They have extensive requirements in terms of data inputs, labor and expertise, and would not be recommended for use by farm managers. They are described here because they underpin many of the more accessible resources. Table III-1 lists the GHGs and operations covered by each tool, while Table III-2 provides further information on each tool, such as its geographic focus and type of interface. Notes and Caveats \uf0b7 These tools typically generate GHG flux data in a format that is not automatically in conformance with this Guidance. Users will often therefore need to reformat these data (e.g., to divide them by scopes) for the purpose of developing a corporate GHG inventory. \uf0b7 This Appendix does not attempt to provide an exhaustive list of tools, but is merely intended as an illustrative guide. The tools listed here may change over time and companies are encouraged to check the corresponding websites for updated information. \uf0b7 Many different combinations of environmental and management factors will affect agricultural GHG fluxes. For example, even if a tool is relevant to, say, \u2018cropland\u2019 or \u2018livestock\u2019 operations, as indicated in Table III-1, it may not cover the specific combinations of interest. \uf0b7 The tools\u2019 coverage of specialty crops and more complex livestock systems is less comprehensive than that for commodity crops and relatively simple livestock systems. \uf0b7 The tools may employ different definitions for the same management practices and land use categories. Companies should ensure that consistent definitions are applied when using multiple tools for a single inventory. \uf0b7 This Appendix focuses on non-mechanical sources, although many of the tools listed will also cover mechanical sources, mostly fuel use and fertilizer production. \uf0b7 Tools for product-, project- and national-level assessments are excluded. 88\n\nGHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance Table III-1.
