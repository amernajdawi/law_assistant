According to climate scientists, global carbon dioxide emissions must be cut by as much as 85 percent below 2000 levels by 2050 to limit global mean temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.1 Temperature rise above this level will produce increasingly unpredictable and dangerous impacts for people and ecosystems. As a result, the need to accelerate efforts to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions is increasingly urgent. Existing government policies will not sufficiently solve the problem. Leadership and innovation from business is vital to making progress. Corporate action in this arena also makes good business an understanding. It allows companies to take into sense. By addressing GHG emissions, companies can account their emissions-related risks and opportunities identify opportunities to bolster their bottom line, and focus company efforts on their greatest GHG reduce risk, and discover competitive advantages. As impacts. Until recently, companies have focused their impacts from climate change become more frequent and attention on emissions from their own operations. But prominent, governments are expected to set new policies increasingly companies understand the need to also and provide additional market-based incentives to drive account for GHG emissions along their value chains and significant reductions in emissions.

In 2008, the British Standards Institution (BSI), in partnership with the UK Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Carbon Trust, published a Publicly Available Specification (PAS) for the assessment of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services, known as PAS 2050.2 The Product Standard builds on the framework and 5.2 Requirements requirements established in the ISO LCA standards (14040:2006, Life Cycle Assessment: Principles and A GHG product inventory shall follow the Framework and 14044:2006, Life Cycle Assessment: life cycle and attributional approaches. Requirements and Guidelines) and PAS 2050, with the intent of providing additional specifications and guidance to facilitate the consistent quantification and public Product GHG inventories,4 also commonly known as reporting of product life cycle GHG inventories. Other product carbon footprints, are a subset of LCA because standards and publications such as the ILCD Handbook3 they focus only on the climate change impact category were also used as reference during the development (the limitations of which are discussed in chapter 1). of this standard. The following sections clarify the However, the accounting methodologies and requirements relationship between the ISO LCA framework and the presented in this standard follow the life cycle approach as Product Standard while identifying two fundamentals on established by ISO LCA standards 14040 and 14044. which the Product Standard is based: the life cycle and attributional approaches to GHG accounting.\n\nr e q u i r e m e n t s The requirements and guidance in this standard follow Box [5.1] The consequential approach the attributional approach to life cycle accounting. The attributional approach is defined as a method in In addition to the attributional approach, another which GHG emissions and removals are attributed to method of life cycle accounting is the consequential the unit of analysis of the studied product by linking approach. The consequential approach is defined as an together attributable processes along its life cycle.5 approach in which processes are included in the life cycle The attributional approach makes use of primary data boundary to the extent that they are expected to change provided by a supplier/customer or average (secondary) as a consequence of a change in demand for the unit of data for a given process. Explanation of the terms unit analysis.6 The consequential approach makes use of data of analysis, attributable processes, and primary data are that is not constrained and can respond to changes in given in chapter 6, chapter 7, and chapter 8, respectively. demand (e.g., marginal technology information), where change in demand can occur as a result of changes in production volumes, production technologies, public policies, and consumer behaviors. Although not followed in this standard, the consequential approach can provide valuable insight in certain applications such as evaluating reduction projects or making public policy decisions.

As with 6.3.3 Defining the unit of analysis for a good, the magnitude, duration, and quality parameters intermediate products may be based on sector or product rules, industry average Intermediate products are used as inputs into final data, or a company-specific reference flow. For example, a products, and the company performing the GHG home insurance company may define their functional unit inventory on an intermediate product may or may not as the provision of premium home insurance coverage for know the function of the final product. For example, a one year. The magnitude and quality of the insurance is steel bar has many uses and therefore the specific end specific to the definition of \u201cpremium.\u201d use may be unknown to a steel producing company. On the other hand, a producer of a specialized intermediate product that is manufactured for a specific use will likely Endnotes know the function of the final product.

In these situations, the total emissions or removals from the common process need to be partitioned among the multiple inputs and outputs. This partitioning is known as allocation, an important and sometimes challenging element of a product inventory process. Accurately allocating emissions or removals to the studied product is essential to maintaining the quality of a GHG inventory. This standard defines two types of products produced This chapter provides requirements and guidance to from common processes: help companies choose the most appropriate allocation method to address common processes in their product \u2022 The studied product for which the GHG inventory is inventory. In addition, definitions and examples of the being prepared methods available to avoid or perform allocation are \u2022 Co-product(s) that have value as an input into another given. The chapter concludes with guidance, including product\u2019s life cycle how to choose between allocation methods. For Inputs to the common process may be services, materials, simplicity, the methods and examples below focus only or energy inputs. Outputs may be intermediate or final on emissions. However, removals are also subject to products, energy outputs (such as electricity or district allocation following the same requirements and guidance. heat), or waste.

Understanding uncertainty can be crucial for properly interpreting inventory results. Identifying and documenting sources of uncertainty can assist companies in understanding the steps needed to improve inventory quality and increase the level of confidence users have in the inventory results. Because the audience for a product inventory report is diverse, companies should make a thorough yet practical effort to communicate the level of confidence and key sources of uncertainty in the inventory results.

These cases are not considered avoided emissions as defined by this standard and therefore are not required to be reported separately from the inventory results. However, the requirements for allocation (chapter 9) and performance tracking (chapter 14) are applicable in these cases.

Carefully and comprehensively documenting the inventory process in a data management plan is a vital step in preparing for assurance. 12.2 Requirements The product GHG inventory shall be assured party other than the reporting company performs by a first or third party. the assurance, this is known as third party assurance.

If a threshold for insignificance was taking the difference between the base inventory and the already established for justified exclusions (see chapter 7) new inventory divided by the base inventory. then the same threshold should be used here.

In results, adding an explanation for their stakeholders as to this case, companies need to create a new base inventory why the emissions increased and what plans the company and set a new reduction target. has to reduce this value in the future.

Therefore the company may assume that 72 percent of the palm oil produced in Malaysia comes from At this point a company can either assume that all the land areas converted from a different land category. This is converted from a different land category (e.g., forest, assumption should not be made if the total area of grassland) to palm (see step 4), or they can estimate cropland is decreasing, or if the country has specific what percentage of land is converted within the cropland efforts in place to convert degraded cropland to pasture category and therefore not subject to land-use change. land or another type of land category.
