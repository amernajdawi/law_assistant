Launched in 1998, the Initiative\u2019s mission is to develop internationally accepted greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and reporting standards for business and to promote their broad adoption. The GHG Protocol Initiative comprises two separate but linked standards: \u2022GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard(this document, which provides a step-by-step guide for companies to use in quantifying and reporting their GHG emissions) \u2022GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard(forthcoming; a guide for quantifying reductions from GHG mitigation projects) 2\n\nINTRODUCTION 3 The first edition of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and The business value of a GHG inventory Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol Corporate Standard), published in Global warming and climate change have come to the fore as a September 2001, enjoyed broad adoption and acceptance around the key sustainable development issue.

Both business and other stakeholders benefit from converging on a common standard. For business, it reduces costs if their GHG inventory is capable of meeting different internal and external information requirements. For others, it improves the consistency, transparency, and understandability of reported information, making it easier to track and compare progress over time.\n\nIntroduction Relationship to other GHG programs GHG calculation tools It is important to distinguish between the GHG Protocol Initiative To complement the standard and guidance provided here, and other GHG programs.

COMPLETENESS Account for and report on all GHG emission sources and activities within the chosen inventory boundary. Disclose and justify any specific exclusions. CONSISTENCY Use consistent methodologies to allow for meaningful comparisons of emissions over time. Transparently document any changes to the data, inventory boundary, methods, or any other relevant factors in the time series. TRANSPARENCY Address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based on a clear audit trail. Disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate references to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources used. ACCURACY Ensure that the quantification of GHG emissions is systematically neither over nor under actual emissions, as far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Achieve sufficient accuracy to enable users to make decisions with reasonable assurance as to the integrity of the reported information. S T A N D A R D GHG accounting and reporting practices are evolving and are new to many businesses; however, the principles listed below are derived in part from generally accepted financial accounting and reporting principles.

Second, if unable to obtain direct consumption data, stores were given standardized guidelines for estimating emissions based on factors such as square footage, equipment type, and usage hours. This system replaced the prior fragmentary approach, provided greater accuracy, and provided a more complete account of emissions by including facilities that previ- ously were unable to calculate emissions. If such limitations in the measurement processes are made transparent, users of the information will understand the basis of the data and the trade - off that has taken place. G U I D A N C E\n\n2 Business Goals and Inventory Design I mproving your understanding of your company\u2019s GHG emissions by compiling a GHG inventory makes good business sense. Companies frequently cite the following five business goals as reasons for compiling a GHG inventory: (cid:127) Managing GHG risks and identifying reduction opportunities (cid:127) Public reporting and participation in voluntary GHG programs (cid:127) Participating in mandatory reporting programs (cid:127) Participating in GHG markets (cid:127) Recognition for early voluntary action G U I D A N C E 10 E C N A D I U G\n\nCHAPTER 2 Business Goals and Inventory Design 11 Companies generally want their GHG inventory to be Appendix C provides an overview of various GHG capable of serving multiple goals.

In the context of future GHG regulations, significant GHG emissions in a company\u2019s value chain may result in increased costs (upstream", "embedding_index": 5}, {"chunk_id": "a744d3f6-e032-4b8d-80a7-0ea0ccb6ad99_6", "text": "posure.\u201d A for different business geographic scales (state, country, company\u2019s GHG exposure is increasingly becoming a Annex 1 countries, non-Annex 1 countries, facility, management issue in light of heightened scrutiny by the business unit, company, etc.). insurance industry, shareholders, and the emergence of environmental regulations/policies designed to reduce GHG emissions. In the context of future GHG regulations, significant GHG emissions in a company\u2019s value chain may result in increased costs (upstream) or reduced sales (down- stream), even if the company itself is not directly subject to regulations. Thus investors may view significant indi- rect emissions upstream or downstream of a company\u2019s operations as potential liabilities that need to be managed and reduced. A limited focus on direct emis- sions from a company\u2019s own operations may miss major GHG risks and opportunities, while leading to a misin- terpretation of the company\u2019s actual GHG exposure. On a more positive note, what gets measured gets managed. Accounting for emissions can help identify the most effective reduction opportunities. This can drive increased materials and energy efficiency as well as the development of new products and services that reduce the GHG impacts of customers or suppliers. This in turn can reduce production costs and help differen- tiate the company in an increasingly environmentally conscious marketplace. Conducting a rigorous GHG inventory is also a prerequisite for setting an internal or public GHG target and for subsequently measuring and reporting progress. G U I D A N C E BOX 1. Business goals served by GHG inventories Managing GHG risks and identifying reduction opportunities (cid:127) Identifying risks associated with GHG constraints in the future (cid:127) Identifying cost effective reduction opportunities (cid:127) Setting GHG targets, measuring and reporting progress Public reporting and participation in voluntary GHG programs (cid:127) Voluntary stakeholder reporting of GHG emissions and progress towards GHG targets (cid:127) Reporting to government and NGO reporting programs, including GHG registries (cid:127) Eco-labelling and GHG certification Participating in mandatory reporting programs (cid:127) Participating in government reporting programs at the national, regional, or local level Participating in GHG markets (cid:127) Supporting internal GHG trading programs (cid:127) Participating in external cap and trade allowance trading programs (cid:127) Calculating carbon/GHG taxes Recognition for early voluntary action (cid:127) Providing information to support \u201cbaseline protection\u201d and/or credit for early action\n\nPublic reporting and participation in voluntary GHG programs As concerns over climate change grow, NGOs, investors, and other stakeholders are increasingly calling for greater corporate disclosure of GHG information. They are interested in the actions companies are taking and in how the companies are positioned relative to their competitors in the face of emerging regulations. In response, a growing number of companies are preparing stakeholder reports containing information on GHG emissions. These may be stand-alone reports on GHG emissions or broader environmental or sustainability reports. For example, companies preparing sustainability reports using the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines should include information on GHG emissions in accor- dance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard(GRI, 2002). Public reporting can also strengthen relation- ships with other stakeholders. For instance, companies can improve their standing with customers and with the public by being recognized for participating in voluntary GHG programs. Some countries and states have established GHG registries where companies can report GHG emissions in a public database. Registries may be administered by governments (e.g., U.S. Department of Energy 1605b Voluntary Reporting Program), NGOs (e.g., California Climate Action Registry), or industry groups (e.g., World Economic Forum Global GHG Registry). Many GHG programs also provide help to companies setting volun- tary GHG targets. Most voluntary GHG programs permit or require the reporting of direct emissions from operations (including all six GHGs), as well as indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity. A GHG inventory prepared in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard will usually be compatible with most requirements (Appendix C provides an overview of the reporting requirements of some GHG programs). However, since the accounting guidelines of many voluntary programs are periodically updated, companies planning to partici- pate are advised to contact the program administrator to check the current requirements.

Because purchased electricity is a major source of GHG emissions for compa- nies, it presents a significant reduction opportunity. IBM, a major information technology company and a member of the WRI\u2019s Green Power Market Development Group, has systematically accounted for these indirect emissions and thus identified the significant potential to reduce them. The company has implemented a variety of strategies that would reduce either their demand for purchased energy or the GHG intensity of that purchased energy. One strategy has been to pursue the renewable energy market to reduce the GHG intensity of its purchased electricity. IBM succeeded in reducing its GHG emissions at its facility in Austin, Texas, even as energy use stayed relatively constant, through a contract for renewable electricity with the local utility company, Austin Energy. Starting in 2001, this five-year contract is for 5.25 million kWhs of wind-power per year. This zero emission power lowered the facility\u2019s inventory by more than 4,100 tonnes of CO 2 compared to the previous year and represents nearly 5% of the facility\u2019s total electricity consumption. Company-wide, IBM\u2019s 2002 total renewable energy procurement was 66.2 million kWh, which represented 1.3% of its electricity consumption worldwide and 31,550 tonnes of CO compared to the previous year. Worldwide, IBM 2 purchased a variety of sources of renewable energy including wind, biomass and solar. By accounting for these indirect emissions and looking for associ- ated reduction opportunities, IBM has successfully reduced an important source of its overall GHG emissions. 12 CHAPTER 2\n\nCHAPTER 2 Business Goals and Inventory Design 13 Participating in mandatory reporting programs Participating in GHG markets Some governments require GHG emitters to report their Market-based approaches to reducing GHG emissions emissions annually.

In Europe, facilities programs, although there are a number of other falling under the requirements of the Integrated approaches adopted by countries, such as the taxation Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive must approach used in Norway. Trading programs can be report emissions exceeding a specified threshold for each implemented on a mandatory (e.g., the forthcoming of the six GHGs.

The UK ETS, for In Ontario, Ontario Regulation 127 requires the example, requires direct entry participants to account reporting of GHG emissions (Ontario MOE, 2001). for GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity (DEFRA, 2003). The CCX allows its members the option of counting indirect emissions asso- ciated with electricity purchases as a supplemental reduction commitment. Other types of indirect emissions can be more difficult to verify and may present challenges in terms of avoiding double counting. To facilitate independent verification, emissions trading G U I D A N C E\n\nmay require participating companies to establish an audit trail for GHG information (see chapter 10). GHG trading programs are likely to impose additional layers of accounting specificity relating to which approach is used for setting organizational boundaries; which GHGs and sources are addressed; how base years are established; the type of calculation method- ology used; the choice of emission factors; and the monitoring and verification approaches employed. The broad participation and best practices incorporated into the GHG Protocol Corporate Standardare likely to inform the accounting requirements of emerging programs, and have indeed done so in the past. Recognition for early voluntary action A credible inventory may help ensure that a corpora- tion\u2019s early, voluntary emissions reductions are recognized in future regulatory programs. To illustrate, suppose that in 2000 a company started reducing its GHG emissions by shifting its on-site powerhouse boiler fuel from coal to landfill gas. If a mandatory GHG reduction program is later established in 2005 and it sets 2003 as the base against which reductions are to be measured, the program might not allow the emissions reductions achieved by the green power project prior to 2003 to count toward its target. However, if a company\u2019s voluntary emissions reductions have been accounted for and registered, they are more likely to be recognized and taken into account when regulations requiring reductions go into effect", "embedding_index": 7}, {"chunk_id": "a744d3f6-e032-4b8d-80a7-0ea0ccb6ad99_8", "text": "-site powerhouse boiler fuel from coal to landfill gas.

However, if a company\u2019s voluntary emissions reductions have been accounted for and registered, they are more likely to be recognized and taken into account when regulations requiring reductions go into effect. For instance, the state of California has stated that it will use its best efforts to ensure that organizations that register certified emission results with the California Climate Action Registry receive appropriate considera- tion under any future international, federal, or state regulatory program relating to GHG emissions. E C N A D I U G Business Goals and Inventory Design Tata Steel: Development of institutional capacity in GHG accounting and reporting For Tata Steel, Asia\u2019s first and India\u2019s largest integrated private sector steel company, reducing its GHG emissions through energy efficiency is a key element of its primary business goal: the acceptability of its product in international markets. Each year, in pursuit of this goal, the company launches several energy effi- ciency projects and introduces less-GHG-intensive processes. The company is also actively pursuing GHG trading markets as a means of further improving its GHG performance. To succeed in these efforts and be eligible for emerging trading schemes, Tata Steel must have an accurate GHG inventory that includes all processes and activities, allows for meaningful benchmarking, measures improvements, and promotes credible reporting. Tata Steel has developed the capacity to measure its progress in reducing GHG emissions. Tata Steel\u2019s managers have access to on-line information on energy usage, material usage, waste and byproduct generation, and other material streams. Using this data and the GHG Protocolcalculation tools, Tata Steel generates two key long-term, strategic performance indicators: specific energy consumption (Giga calorie/ tonne of crude steel) and GHG intensity (tonne of COequivalent/ tonne of crude steel). These 2 indicators are key sustainability metrics in the steel sector world- wide, and help ensure market acceptability and competitiveness. Since the company adopted the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, tracking performance has become more structured and stream- lined. This system allows Tata Steel quick and easy access to its GHG inventory and helps the company maximize process and material flow efficiencies. 14 CHAPTER 2\n\nCHAPTER 2 Business Goals and Inventory Design 15 G U I D A N C E Ford Motor Company: Experiences using the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard When Ford Motor Company, a global automaker, embarked on an divestitures?

A notable exception is the oil and gas industry, which often has complex ownership/ operatorship structures. Thus, Equity share approach the choice of control criterion in the oil and gas industry Under the equity share approach, a company accounts for can have substantial consequences for a company\u2019s GHG GHG emissions from operations according to its share of inventory. In making this choice, companies should equity in the operation. The equity share reflects economic take into account how GHG emissions accounting and interest, which is the extent of rights a company has to the reporting can best be geared to the requirements of risks and rewards flowing from an operation. Typically, the emissions reporting and trading schemes, how it can be share of economic risks and rewards in an operation is aligned with financial and environmental reporting, aligned with the company\u2019s percentage ownership of that and which criterion best reflects the company\u2019s actual operation, and equity share will normally be the same as power of control. the ownership percentage.

The company has the right to the majority of benefits of the staff preparing the inventory may therefore need to operation, however these rights are conveyed. Similarly, consult with the company\u2019s accounting or legal staff to a company is considered to financially control an ensure that the appropriate equity share percentage is operation if it retains the majority risks and rewards applied for each joint operation (see Table 1 for definitions of ownership of the operation\u2019s assets. of financial accounting categories). Under this criterion, the economic substance of the relationship between the company and the operation takes precedence over the legal ownership status, so that the company may have financial control over the operation even if it has less than a 50 percent interest in that operation. In assessing the economic substance of the relationship, the impact of potential voting rights, including both those held by the company and those held by other parties, is also taken into account. This criterion is consistent with international financial accounting standards; therefore, a company has finan- cial control over an operation for GHG accounting purposes if the operation is considered as a group company or subsidiary for the purpose of financial S T A N D A R D\n\nconsolidation, i.e., if the operation is fully consolidated Table 2 in the guidance section of this chapter illustrates in financial accounts.

It should be emphasized that having operational control does not mean that a company necessarily has authority to make all decisions concerning an operation. For example, big capital investments will likely require the approval of all the partners that have joint financial control. Operational control does mean that a company has the authority to introduce and implement its operating policies. More information on the relevance and application of the operational control criterion is provided in petroleum industry guidelines for reporting GHG emissions (IPIECA, 2003). Sometimes a company can have joint financial control over an operation, but not operational control. In such cases, the company would need to look at the contractual arrangements to determine whether any one of the part- ners has the authority to introduce and implement its operating policies at the operation and thus has the responsibility to report emissions under operational control. If the operation itself will introduce and imple- ment its own operating policies, the partners with joint financial control over the operation will not report any emissions under operational control. D R A D N A T S Setting Organizational Boundaries BP: Reporting on the basis of equity share BP reports GHG emissions on an equity share basis, including those operations where BP has an interest, but where BP is not the operator. In determining the extent of the equity share reporting boundary BP seeks to achieve close alignment with financial accounting procedures. BP\u2019s equity share boundary includes all operations undertaken by BP and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings as determined by their treatment in the financial accounts. Fixed asset investments, i.e., where BP has limited influence, are not included. GHGemissions from facilities in which BP has an equity share are estimated according to the requirements of the BP Group Reporting Guidelines for Environmental Performance (BP 2000). In those facilities where BP has an equity share but is not the operator, GHGemissions data may be obtained directly from the operating company using a methodology consistent with the BP Guidelines, or is calculated by BPusing activity data provided by the operator. BP reports its equity share GHG emissions every year. Since 2000, independent external auditors have expressed the opinion that the reported total has been found to be free from material misstatement when audited against the BP Guidelines. 18 CHAPTER 3\n\nCHAPTER 3 Setting Organizational Boundaries 19 TABLE 1.

Hence, for assessing risk, GHG reporting on the basis of the equity share and financial control approaches provides a more complete picture. The equity share approach is likely to result in the most comprehensive coverage of liability and risks. In the future, companies might incur liabilities for GHGemissions produced by joint operations in which they have an interest, but over which they do not have financial control. For example, a company that is an equity shareholder in an operation but has no financial control over it might face demands by the companies with a controlling share to cover its requisite share of GHGcompliance costs. (cid:127) Alignment with financial accounting.Future financial accounting standards may treat GHG emissions as liabilities and emissions allowances/ credits as assets.

G U I D A N C E Royal Dutch/Shell: Reporting on the basis of operational control In the oil and gas industry, ownership and control structures are often complex. A group may own less than 50 percent of a venture\u2019s equity capital but have operational control over the venture. On the other hand, in some situations, a group may hold a majority interest in a venture without being able to exert opera- tional control, for example, when a minority partner has a veto vote at the board level. Because of these complex ownership and control structures, Royal Dutch/Shell, a global group of energy and petrochemical companies, has chosen to report its GHG emis- sions on the basis of operational control. By reporting 100 percent of GHG emissions from all ventures under its operational control, irrespective of its share in the ventures\u2019 equity capital, Royal Dutch/Shell can ensure that GHG emissions reporting is in line with its operational policy including its Health, Safety and Environmental Performance Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines. Using the operational control approach, the group generates data that is consistent, reliable, and meets its quality standards.\n\nE C N A D I U G Setting Organizational Boundaries FIGURE 1.

This involves identifying emissions associated with its operations, categorizing them as direct and indirect emissions, and choosing the scope of accounting and reporting for indirect emissions.

The selected operational boundary is then For example, they may subdivide data by business uniformly applied to identify and categorize direct and unit/facility, country, source type (stationary combustion, indirect emissions at each operational level (see Box 2). process, fugitive, etc.), and activity type (production The established organizational and operational bound- of electricity, consumption of electricity, generation or aries together constitute a company\u2019s inventory boundary. purchased electricity that is sold to end users, etc.). In addition to the six Kyoto gases, companies may also provide emissions data for other GHGs (e.g., Montreal Protocol gases) to give context to changes in emission levels of Kyoto Protocol gases. Switching from a CFC to HFC, for example, will increase emissions of Kyoto Protocol gases. Information on emissions of GHGs other than the six Kyoto gases may be reported separately from the scopes in a GHG public report. Together the three scopes provide a comprehensive accounting framework for managing and reducing direct and indirect emissions. Figure 3 provides an overview of the relationship between the scopes and the activities that generate direct and indirect emissions along a company\u2019s value chain. A company can benefit from efficiency gains throughout the value chain. Even without any policy drivers, accounting for GHG emissions along the value chain may reveal potential for greater efficiency and lower costs (e.g., the use of fly ash as a clinker substitute in the manufacture of cement that reduces downstream emis- sions from processing of waste fly ash, and upstream 26 CHAPTER 4 E C N A D I U G A BOX 2. Organizational and operational boundaries Organization X is a parent company that has full ownership and financial control of operations A and B, but only a 30% non- operated interest and no financial control in operation C. Setting Organizational Boundary: X would decide whether to account for GHG emissions by equity share or financial control. If the choice is equity share, X would include A and B, as well as 30% of C\u2019s emissions. If the approach chosen is financial control, X would count only A and B\u2019s emissions as relevant and subject to consolidation. Once this has been decided, the organizational boundary has been defined. Setting Operational Boundary: Once the organizational boundary is set, X then needs to decide, on the basis of its business goals, whether to account only for scope 1 and scope 2, or whether to include relevant scope 3 categories for its operations. Operations A, B and C (if the equity approach is selected) account for the GHG emissions in the scopes chosen by X, i.e., they apply the corporate policy in drawing up their operational boundaries.

(cid:127) If fossil fuel or electricity is required to use the company\u2019s products, product use phase emissions may be a relevant category to report.

Through participation in the Business Leaders Initiative on Climate Change, the company found that 98 percent of its emissions in Sweden originate from the transport of goods via outsourced partner transportation firms. Each partner is required, as an element of the subcontract payment scheme, to enter data on vehicles used, distance traveled, fuel efficiency, and background data. This data is used to calculate total emissions via a tailored calculation tool for outsourced transportation which gives a detailed picture of its scope 3 emissions. Linking data to specific carriers allows the company to screen individual carriers for environmental performance and affect decisions based on each carrier\u2019s emissions performance, which is seen through scope 3 as DHL\u2019s own performance. By including scope 3 and promoting GHG reductions throughout the value chain, DHL Express Nordic increased the relevance of its emissions footprint, expanded opportunities for reducing its impacts and improved its ability to recognize cost saving opportu- nities. Without scope 3, DHL Express Nordic would have lacked much of the information needed to be able to understand and effec- tively manage its emissions.

E C N A D I U G Tracking Emissions Over Time ENDESA: Recalculation of base year emissions because of structural changes TheGHG Protocol Corporate Standardrequires setting a base year for comparing emissions over time. To be able to compare over time, the base year emissions must be recalculated if any structural changes occur in the company. In a deal completed January 2002, the ENDESA Group, a power generation company based in Spain, sold its 87.5 percent holding in Viesgo, a part of its Spanish power genera- tion business, to ENEL, an Italian power company. To account for this structural change, historical emissions from the six power plants included in the sale were no longer accounted for in the Endesa GHG inventory and therefore removed from its base year emissions. This recalculation provides ENDESA with a complete and comparable picture of its historical emissions. 38 CHAPTER 5\n\nCHAPTER 5 Tracking Emissions Over Time 39 FIGURE 8.

Organic growth/decline refers to increases or decreases in production output, changes in product mix, and closures and openings of operating units that are owned or controlled by the company. The rationale for this is that organic growth or decline results in a change of emissions to the atmosphere and therefore needs to be counted as an increase or decrease in the company\u2019s emissions profile over time. \u27a1 Facility C Unit B 15 Unit A Figures reported in respective years Recalculated figures 20 20 15 30 30 30 30 25 25 25 30 30 25 30 30 1 2 3 Company Teta consists of two business units (A and B).

At the beginning of year three, Teta acquires a production facility C from another company. Facility C came into existence in year two, its emissions being 15 tonnes CO in year two and 20 tonnes CO in year 2 2 three. The total emissions of company Teta in year three, including facility C, are therefore 80 tonnes CO. In this acquisition case, the 2 base year emissions of company Teta do not change because the acquired facility C did not exist in year one when the base year of Teta was set. The base year emissions of Teta therefore remain at 50 tonnes CO. Teta (optionally) reports 75 tonnes as the recalculated figure 2 for year two emissions. SNOISSIME ATET G U I D A N C E 20 NOTES 1 Terminology on this topic can be confusing. Base year emissions should be differentiated from the term \u201cbaseline,\u201d which is mostly used in the context of project-based accounting. The term base year focuses on a comparison of emissions over time, while a baseline is a hypothetical scenario for what GHG emissions would have been in the absence of a GHG reduction project or activity. 2 For moreinformation on the timing of base year emissions recalcula- tions, see the guidance document \u201cBase year recalculation methodologies for structural changes\u201d on the GHG Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org).\n\nE C N A D I U G 6 Identifying and Calculating GHG Emissions O nce the inventory boundary has been established, companies generally calculate GHG emissions using the following steps: 1.

This allows a company to use specifically developed methodologies to accu- rately calculate the emissions from each sector and source category. Identify GHG emissions sources The first of the five steps in identifying and calculating a company\u2019s emissions as outlined in Figure 9 is to categorize the GHG sources within that company\u2019s boundaries. GHG emissions typically occur from the following source categories: (cid:127) Stationary combustion: combustion of fuels in stationary equipment such as boilers, furnaces, sions and own or control a power production facility will burners, turbines, heaters, incinerators, engines, likely have direct emissions from all the main source flares, etc. categories.

There are two main categories of calculation tools: (cid:127) Cross-sector toolsthat can be applied to different sectors.

E C N A D I U G Identifying and Calculating GHG Emissions United Technologies Corporation: More than meets the eye In 1996, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a global aero- space and building systems technology corporation, appointed a team to set boundaries for the company\u2019s new Natural Resource Conservation, Energy and Water Use Reporting Program. The team focused on what sources of energy should be included in the program's annual report of energy consumption. The team decided jet fuel needed to be reported in the annual report; jet fuel was used by a number of UTC divisions for engine and flight hard- ware testing and for test firing. Although the amount of jet fuel used in any given year was subject to wide variation due to changing test schedules, the total amount consumed in an average year was believed to be large and potentially small enough to be specifically excluded. However, jet fuel consumption reports proved that initial belief incorrect. Jet fuel has accounted for between 9 and 13 percent of the corporation's total annual use of energy since the program commenced. Had UTC not included the use of jet fuel in annual data collection efforts, a significant emissions source would have been overlooked. 42 CHAPTER 6\n\nCHAPTER 6 Identifying and Calculating GHG Emissions 43 Most companies will need to use more than one calcu- The guidance for each calculation tool includes the lation tool to cover all their GHG emission sources. following sections: For example, to calculate GHG emissions from an (cid:127) Overview: provides an overview of the purpose and aluminum production facility, the company would use content of the tool, the calculation method used in the the calculation tools for aluminum production, tool, and a process description stationary combustion (for any consumption of purchased electricity, generation of energy on-site, etc), (cid:127) Choosing activity data and emission factors:provides mobile combustion (for transportation of materials and sector-specific good practice guidance and references products by train, vehicles employed on-site, employee for default emission factors business travel, etc), and HFC use (for refrigeration, (cid:127) Calculation methods:describes different calculation etc).

Default emis- sion factors are provided for the sectors covered, but it is also possible to insert customized emission factors that are more representative of the reporting company\u2019s oper- ations. The emissions of each GHG (CO, CH, NO, etc.) 2 4 2 are calculated separately and then converted to CO 2 equivalents on the basis of their global warming potential. Some tools, such as the iron and steel sector tool and the HFC cross-sector tool, take a tiered approach, offering a choice between a simple and a more advanced calculation methodology. The more advanced methods are expected to produce more accurate emissions estimates but usually require collection of more detailed data and a more thorough understanding of a company\u2019s technologies. Roll-up GHG emissions data to corporate level To report a corporation\u2019s total GHG emissions, compa- nies will usually need to gather and summarize data from multiple facilities, possibly in different countries and business divisions. It is important to plan this process carefully to minimize the reporting burden, reduce the risk of errors that might occur while compiling data, and ensure that all facilities are collecting information on an approved, consistent basis. Ideally, corporations will integrate GHG reporting with For internal reporting up to the corporate level, it is their existing reporting tools and processes, and take recommended that standardized reporting formats advantage of any relevant data already collected and be used to ensure that data received from different reported by facilities to division or corporate offices, business units and facilities is comparable, and that regulators or other stakeholders. internal reporting rules are observed (see BP case study). Standardized formats can significantly reduce The tools and processes chosen to report data will the risk of errors. depend upon the information and communication infra- structure already in place (i.e., how easy is it to include new data categories in corporate databases). It will also depend upon the amount of detail that corporate head- quarters wishes to be reported from facilities. Data collection and management tools could include: (cid:127) Secure databases available over the company intranet or internet, for direct data entry by facilities (cid:127) Spreadsheet templates filled out and e-mailed to a corpo- rate or division office, where data is processed further (cid:127) Paper reporting forms faxed to a corporate or division office where data is re-entered in a corporate data- base. However, this method may increase the likelihood of errors if there are not sufficient checks in place to ensure the accurate transfer of the data.

The responsibility for reporting environmental emissions lies with about 320 individual BP facilities and business depart- ments, which are termed \u201creporting units.\u201d All reporting units have to complete a standard Excel pro-forma spreadsheet every quarter, stating actual emissions for the preceding three months and updates to forecasts for the current year and the next two years. In addition, reporting units are asked to account for all significant variances, including sustainable reductions. The reporting units all use the same BP GHG Reporting Guidelines \u201cProtocol\u201d (BP, 2000) for quantifying their emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. All pro-forma spreadsheets are e-mailed automatically by the central database to the reporting units, and the completed e-mail returns are uploaded into the database by a corporate team, who check the quality of the incoming data. The data are then compiled, by the end of the month following each quarter end, to provide the total emission inventory and forecasts for analysis against BP\u2019s GHG target. Finally, the inventory is reviewed by a team of inde- pendent external auditors to provide assurance on the quality and accuracy of the data.\n\nApproaches for rolling up DECENTRALIZED APPROACH: GHG emissions data to corporate level INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES CALCULATE GHG EMISSIONS DATA There are two basic approaches for gathering data on GHG Asking facilities to calculate GHG emissions themselves emissions from a corporation\u2019s facilities (Figure 10): will help to increase their awareness and understanding of the issue.

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standardrecognizes that these reasons are a function of a company\u2019s goals and its expectations for the future. A company\u2019s goals for and vision of the evolution of the GHG emissions issue should guide the design of its corporate inventory, the implementation of a quality management system, and the treatment of uncertainty within its inventory.

The information may have little or no value or use and may goal of a quality management system is to ensure that even incur penalties. For example, a company may these principles are put into practice. currently be focusing on a voluntary GHG program but also want its inventory data to meet the anticipated requirements of a future when emissions may have monetary value. A quality management system is essential to ensuring that an inventory continues to meet the principles of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and anticipates the requirements of future GHG emissions programs. Even if a company is not anticipating a future regulatory mechanism, internal and external stakeholders will demand high quality inventory information. Therefore, the implementation of some type of quality management system is important. However, the GHG Protocol Corporate Standardrecognizes that companies do not have unlim- ited resources, and, unlike financial accounting, corporate GHG inventories involve a level of scientific and engineering complexity. Therefore, companies should develop their inventory program and quality manage- ment system as a cumulative effort in keeping with their resources, the broader evolution of policy, and their own corporate vision. A quality management system provides a systematic process for preventing and correcting errors, and identifies areas where investments will likely lead to the greatest improvement in overall inventory quality. However, the primary objective of quality management is ensuring the credibility of a company\u2019s GHG inven- tory information. The first step towards achieving this objective is defining inventory quality. G U I D A N C E KPMG: The value of integrating GHG management with existing systems KPMG, a global services company, found that a key factor in the derivation of reliable, verifiable GHG data is the integration of GHG data management and reporting mechanisms with compa- nies\u2019 core operational management and assurance processes. This is because: \u2022It is more efficient to widen the scope of existing embedded management and assurance processes than to develop a separate function responsible for generating and reporting GHG information. \u2022As GHG information becomes increasingly monetized, it will attract the same attention as other key performance indicators of businesses. Therefore, management will need to ensure adequate procedures are in place to report reliable data. These procedures can most effectively be implemented by functions within the organization that oversee corporate governance, internal audit, IT, and company reporting. Another factor that is often not given sufficient emphasis is training of personnel and communication of GHG objectives. Data generation and reporting systems are only as reliable as the people who operate them. Many well-designed systems fail because the precise reporting needs of the company are not adequately explained to the people who have to interpret a reporting standard and calculation tools. Given the complexity of accounting boundaries and an element of subjectivity that must accompany source inclusion and equity share, inconsistent inter- pretation of reporting requirements is a real risk. It is also important that those responsible for supplying input data are aware of its use. The only way to minimize this risk is through clear communication, adequate training and knowledge sharing.\n\nAn inventory program framework management, these processes and systems may be inte- A practical framework is needed to help companies grated, where appropriate, with other corporate conceptualize and design a quality management system processes related to quality. and to help plan for future improvements.

A company\u2019s quality management system and overall inventory program should be treated as evolving, in keeping with a company\u2019s reasons for preparing an inventory. The plan should address the company\u2019s strategy for a multi-year implementation (i.e., recognize that inventories are a long-term effort), including steps to ensure that all quality control findings from previous years are adequately addressed.

For fuel consumption, published emission factors based on fuel energy content are gener- ally more accurate than those based on mass or volume, except when mass or volume based factors have been measured at the company- or site-specific level. Quality investigations need to assess the representativeness and applicability of emission factors and other parameters to the specific characteristics of a company. Differences between measured and default values need to be qualita- tively explained and justified based upon the company\u2019s operational characteristics. ACTIVITY DATA The collection of high quality activity data will often be the most significant limitation for corporate GHG inven- tories. Therefore, establishing robust data collection procedures needs to be a priority in the design of any company\u2019s inventory program. The following are useful measures for ensuring the quality of activity data: (cid:127) Develop data collection procedures that allow the same (cid:127) Investigate activity data that is generated for purposes data to be efficiently collected in future years. other than preparing a GHG inventory.

G U I D A N C E Interface: Integration of emissions and business data systems Interface, Inc., is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of carpet tiles and upholstery fabrics for commercial interiors. The company has established an environmental data system that mirrors its corpo- rate financial data reporting. The Interface EcoMetrics system is designed to provide activity and material flow data from business units in a number of countries (the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Thailand and throughout Europe) and provides metrics for measuring progress on environmental issues such as GHG emissions. Using company-wide accounting guidelines and standards, energy and material input data are reported to a central database each quarter and made available to sustainability personnel. These data are the foundation of Interface\u2019s annual inventory and enable data comparison over time in the pursuit of improved quality. Basing emissions data systems on financial reporting helps Interface improve its data quality. Just as financial data need to be documented and defensible, Interface\u2019s emissions data are held to standards that promote an increasingly transparent, accurate, and high-quality inventory. Integrating its financial and emissions data systems has made Interface\u2019s GHG accounting and reporting more useful as it strives to be a \u201ccompletely sustainable company\u201d by 2020.\n\n(cid:127) Investigate whether biases or other characteristics that Inventory quality and inventory uncertainty could affect data quality have been previously identi- Preparing a GHG inventory is inherently both an fied (e.g., by communicating with experts at a accounting and a scientific exercise.

One Uncertainties associated with GHG inventories can potential measure of data quality is a quantitative and be broadly categorized into scientific uncertaintyand qualitative assessment of their uncertainty. estimation uncertainty. Scientific uncertainty arises when the science of the actual emission and/or removal process is not completely understood. For example, many direct and indirect factors associated with global warming potential (GWP) values that are used to combine emission estimates for various GHGs involve significant scientific uncertainty. Analyzing and quanti- fying such scientific uncertainty is extremely problematic and is likely to be beyond the capacity of most company inventory programs. E C N A D I U G Managing Inventory Quality Vauxhall Motors: The importance of accuracy checks The experience of the U.K. automotive manufacturer Vauxhal Motors illustrates the importance of attention to detail in setting up GHG information collection systems. The company wished to calculate GHG emissions from staff air travel. However, when determining the impact of flight travel, it is important to make sure that the round trip distance is used when calculating emissions. Fortunately, Vauxhall\u2019s review of its assumptions and calculation methodologies revealed this fact and avoided reporting emissions that were 50 percent lower than the actual value. 54 CHAPTER 7\n\nCHAPTER 7 Managing Inventory Quality 55 Estimation uncertainty arises any time GHG emissions are quantified. Therefore all emissions or removal esti- mates are associated with estimation uncertainty. Estimation uncertainty can be further classified into two types:model uncertainty andparameter uncertainty.3 Model uncertaintyrefers to the uncertainty associated with the mathematical equations (i.e., models) used to characterize the relationships between various parame- ters and emission processes. For example, model uncertainty may arise either due to the use of an incor- rect mathematical model or inappropriate input into the model. As with scientific uncertainty, estimating model uncertainty is likely to be beyond most company\u2019s inventory efforts; however, some companies may wish to utilize their unique scientific and engi- neering expertise to evaluate the uncertainty in their emission estimation models. Parameter uncertaintyrefers to the uncertainty associ- ated with quantifying the parameters used as inputs (e.g., activity data and emission factors) into estima- tion models. Parameter uncertainties can be evaluated through statistical analysis, measurement equipment precision determinations, and expert judgment. Quantifying parameter uncertainties and then esti- mating source category uncertainties based on these parameter uncertainties will be the primary focus of companies that choose to investigate the uncertainty in their emission inventories.

LIMITATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATES Given that only parameter uncertainties are within the feasible scope of most companies, uncertainty estimates for corporate GHG inventories will, of necessity, be imperfect. Complete and robust sample data will not always be available to assess the statistical uncertainty4 in every parameter.

Second, it can help (in combination 4Statistical uncertainty results from natural variations (e.g., random with data quality investigations) identify, explain, and quantify both human errors in the measurement process and fluctuations in measure- statistical and systematic uncertainties. ment equipment). Statistical uncertainty can be detected through repeated experiments or sampling of data. 7It should be recognized, however, that biases may not be constant from year to year but instead may exhibit a pattern over time (e.g., may be growing or falling). For example, a company that continues to disinvest in collecting high quality data may create a situation in which the biases in its data get worse each year. These types of data quality issues are extremely problematic because of the effect they can have on calculated emission trends. In such cases, systematic parameter uncertainties cannot be ignored.\n\nE C N A D I U G 8 Accounting for GHG Reductions A s voluntary reporting, external GHG programs, and emission trading systems evolve, it is becoming more and more essential for compa- nies to understand the implications of accounting for GHG emissions changes over time on the one hand, and, on the other hand, accounting for offsets or credits that result from GHG reduction projects.

These reductions need not be reported separately unless they are sold, traded externally, or otherwise used as an offset or credit. However, some companies may be able to make changes to their own operations that result in GHG emissions changes at sources not included in their own inventory boundary, or not captured by comparing emissions changes over time. For example: (cid:127) Substituting fossil fuel with waste-derived fuel that might otherwise be used as landfill or incinerated without energy recovery. Such substitution may have no direct effect on (or may even increase) a company\u2019s own GHG emissions. However, it could result in emissions reductions elsewhere by another organization, e.g., through avoiding landfill gas and fossil fuel use.

G U I D A N C E Alcoa: Taking advantage of renewable energy certificates Alcoa, a global manufacturer of aluminum, is implementing a variety of strategies to reduce its GHG emissions. One approach has been to purchase renewable energy certificates, or RECs, to offset some of the company\u2019s GHG emissions. RECs, which repre- sent the environmental benefits of renewable energy unbundled from the actual flow of electrons, are an innovative method of providing renewable energy to individual customers. RECs repre- sent the unbundled environmental benefits, such as avoided CO 2 emissions, generated by producing electricity from renewable rather than fossil sources. RECs can be sold bundled with the electricity (as green power) or separately to customers interested in supporting renewable energy. Alcoa found that RECs offer a variety of advantages, including direct access to the benefits of renewable energy for facilities that may have limited renewable energy procurement options. In October 2003, Alcoa began purchasing RECs equivalent to 100% of the electricity used annually at four corporate offices in Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and New York. The RECs Alcoa is purchasing effec- tively mean that the four corporate centers are now operating on electricity generated by projects that produce electricity from land- fill gas, avoiding the emission of more than 6.3 million kilograms (13.9 million pounds) of carbon dioxide annually. Alcoa chose RECs in part because the supplier was able to provide RECs to all four facilities through one contract. This flexibility lowered the administrative cost of purchasing renewable energy for multiple facilities that are served by different utilities. For more information on RECs, see the Green Power Market Development Group\u2019s Corporate Guide to Green Power Markets: Installment #5 (WRI, 2003). NOTES 1 Primary effects are the specific GHG reducing elements or activities (reducing GHG emissions, carbon storage, or enhancing GHG removals) that the project is intended to achieve. 2 This problem with the temporary nature of GHG reductions is sometimes referred to as the \u201cpermanence\u201d issue. 3 The term \u201cGHG trades\u201d refers to all purchases or sales of allowances, offsets, and credits.\n\nReporting GHG Emissions A credible GHG emissions report presents relevant information that is complete, consistent, accurate and transparent. While it takes time to develop a rigorous and complete corporate inventory of GHG emissions, knowledge will improve with experience in calculating and reporting data. It is therefore recommended that a public GHG report: (cid:127) Be based on the best data available at the time of publication, while being transparent about its limitations (cid:127) Communicate any material discrepancies identified in previous years (cid:127) Include the company\u2019s gross emissions for its chosen inventory boundary separate from and independent of any GHG trades it might engage in.

For national or voluntary GHG programs, or for internal management Use of ratio indicators purposes, reporting requirements may vary (Appendix C summarizes the requirements of various GHG programs). Two principal aspects of GHG performance are of interest to management and stakeholders. One concerns For public reporting, it is important to differentiate the overall GHG impact of a company\u2014that is the between a summary of a public report that is, for absolute quantity of GHG emissions released to the example, published on the Internet or in Sustainability/ atmosphere. The other concerns the company\u2019s GHG Corporate Social Responsibility reporting (e.g., emissions normalized by some business metric that Global Reporting Initiative) and a full public report results in a ratio indicator. The GHG Protocol Corporate that contains all the necessary data as specified by the Standardrequires reporting of absolute emissions; reporting standard spelled out in this volume. Not reporting of ratio indicators is optional. every circulated report must contain all information as specified by this standard, but a link or reference Ratio indicators provide information on performance needs to be made to a publicly available full report relative to a business type and can facilitate compar- where all information is available. isons between similar products and processes over time.

Intensity ratios express GHG impact per unit of physical activity or unit of economic output. A physical intensity ratio is suitable when aggre- gating or comparing across businesses that have similar products. An economic intensity ratio is suitable when aggregating or comparing across businesses that produce different products. A declining intensity ratio reflects a positive performance improvement. Many companies historically tracked environmental perform- ance with intensity ratios. Intensity ratios are often called \u201cnormalized\u201d environmental impact data. Examples of intensity ratios include product emission intensity (e.g., tonnes of CO emissions per electricity 2 generated); service intensity (e.g., GHG emissions per function or per service); and sales intensity (e.g., emis- sions per sales). PERCENTAGES. A percentage indicator is a ratio between two similar issues (with the same physical unit in the numerator and the denominator). Examples of percentages that can be meaningful in performance reports include current GHG emissions expressed as a percentage of base year GHG emissions. For further guidance on ratio indicators refer to CCAR, 2003; GRI, 2002; Verfaillie and Bidwell, 2000.

GHG emissions data, an external verification will be difficult and may result in the verifier being unable to issue an opinion. Under these circumstances, the veri- fiers may make recommendations on how current data collection and collation process should be improved so that an opinion can be obtained in future years. Companies are responsible for ensuring the existence, quality and retention of documentation so as to create an audit trail of how the inventory was compiled. If a company issues a specific base year against which it assesses its GHG performance, it should retain all relevant historical records to support the base year data. These issues should be born in mind when designing and implementing GHG data processes and procedures. Using the verification findings Before the verifiers will verify that an inventory has met the relevant quality standard, they may require the company to adjust any material errors that they identi- fied during the course of the verification. If the verifiers and the company cannot come to an agreement regarding adjustments, then the verifier may not be able to provide the company with an unqualified opinion. All material errors (individually or in aggregate) need to be amended prior to the final verification sign off.

Often, a corporate GHG emission reduction target is the logical follow-up to developing a GHG inventory. G U I D A N C E 74\n\nCHAPTER 11 Setting a GHG Target 75 This chapter provides guidance on the process of setting and reporting on a corporate GHG target. Although the chapter focuses on emissions, many of the consid- erations equally apply to GHG sequestration (see Appendix B). It is not the purpose of this chapter to prescribe what a company\u2019s target should be, rather the focus is on the steps involved, the choices to be made, and the implications of those choices. Why Set a GHG Target? Any robust business strategy requires setting targets for revenues, sales, and other core business indicators, as well as tracking performance against those targets. Likewise, effective GHG management involves setting a GHG target. As companies develop strategies to reduce the GHG emissionsof their products and operations, corporate-wide GHG targets are often key elements of these efforts, even if some parts of the company are or will be subject to mandatory GHG limits. Common drivers for setting a GHG target include: (cid:127) MINIMIZING AND MANAGING GHG RISKS While developing a GHG inventory is an important step towards identifying GHG risks and opportunities, a GHG target is a planning tool that can actually drive GHG reductions. A GHG target will help raise internal awareness about the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and ensure the issue is on the busi- ness agenda. This can serve to minimize and more effectively manage the business risks associated with climate change. (cid:127) ACHIEVING COST SAVINGS AND STIMULATING INNOVATION Implementing a GHG target can result in cost savings by driving improvements in process innovation and resource efficiency. Targets that apply to products can drive R&D, which in turn creates products and serv- ices that can increase market share and reduce emissions associated with the use of products. (cid:127) PREPARING FOR FUTURE REGULATIONS Internal accountability and incentive mechanisms that are established to support a target\u2019s implementation can also equip companies to respond more effectively to future GHG regulations. For example, some compa- nies have found that experimenting with internal GHG trading programs has allowed them to better under- stand the possible impacts of future trading programs on the company. \u27a1 G U I D A N C E FIGURE 12.

This can improve a company\u2019s standing with customers, employees, investors, business partners, and the public, and enhance brand reputation. (cid:127) PARTICIPATING IN VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS A growing number of voluntary GHG programs are emerging to encourage and assist companies in setting, implementing, and tracking progress toward GHG targets. Participation in voluntary programs can result in public recognition, may facilitate recog- nition of early action by future regulations, and enhance a company\u2019s GHG accounting and reporting capacity and understanding. Steps in Setting a Target Setting a GHG target involves making choices among various strategies for defining and achieving a GHG reduction. The business goals, any relevant policy context, and stakeholder discussions should inform these choices. The following sections outline the ten steps involved. Although presented sequentially, in practice target setting involves cycling back and forth between the steps. It is assumed that the company has developed a GHG inventory before implementing these steps. Figure 12 summarizes the steps. 1. Obtain senior management commitment As with any corporate wide target, senior management buy-in and commitment particularly at the board/CEO level is a prerequisite for a successful GHG reduction program. Implementing a reduction target is likely to necessitate changes in behavior and decision-making throughout the organization. It also requires estab- lishing an internal accountability and incentive system and providing adequate resources to achieve the target. This will be difficult, if not impossible, without senior management commitment. E C N A D I U G Setting a GHG Target BOX 4.

It was concluded that successful implementation required different targets at different levels of the company. This is because each of the components that underlie absolute GHG emissions is influenced by decision-making at various management levels (from the corporate level down to indi- vidual businesses and facilities). Absolute GHG emissions at a plant (tonnes of CO -e.) = Function (MP x BPE x PE) 2 MP Quantity of product manufactured by a facility. This is fundamental to the need to grow and is therefore controlled at corporate level. GHG emissions are typically not managed by limiting this component. BPE Best process energy use per tonne. The optimal (or theoretical) energy consumed (translates to emissions) by a particular design of plant. The type of plant built is a business-level decision. Significant capital decisions may be involved in building a new plant incorporating new technology. For existing plants, BPE is improved by significant design change and retrofitting. This could also involve large capital expenditure. PE Plant efficiency index. An index that indicates how the plant is actually performing relative to BPE. PE is a result of day-to-day decisions taken by plant operators and technicians. It is improved also by the Shell Global Solutions EnergiseTM programme, which typically requires low capital expenditure to implement. Royal Dutch/Shell found that while this model is probably an oversimplification when it comes to exploration and production facilities, it is suitable for manufacturing facilities (e.g., refineries and chemical plants). It illustrates that an absolute target could only be set at the corporate level, while lower levels require intensity or efficiency targets.

The quality of the GHG inventory should be a key factor informing this choice. The questions to be addressed in this step include the following: (cid:127) WHICH GHGS?

For companies with global operations, it makes sense to limit the target\u2019s geographical scope until a robust and reli- able inventory has been developed for all operations. Companies that participate in GHG programs involving trading2 will need to decide whether or not to include the emissions sources covered in the trading program in their corporate target. If common sources are included, i.e., if there is overlap in sources covered between the corporate target and the trading program, companies should consider how they will address anydouble counting resulting from the trading of GHG reductions in the trading program (see step 8). (cid:127) WHICH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSION SOURCES? Including indirect GHG emissions in a target will facilitate more cost-effective reductions by increasing the reduction opportunities available. However, indirect emissions are generally harder to measure accurately and verify than direct emissions although some categories, such as scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity, may be amenable to accurate measurement and verification. Including indirect emissions can raise issues with regard to ownership and double counting of reductions, as indirect emis- sions are by definition someone else\u2019s direct emissions (see step 8). (cid:127) SEPARATE TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES? For companies with diverse operations it may make more sense to define separate GHG targets for different core businesses, especially when using an intensity target, where the most meaningful business metric for defining the target varies across business units (e.g., GHGs per tonne of cement produced or barrel of oil refined).

For Beta to meet its target, it is sufficient for its emissions to be, in the year 2010, no more than 90 percent of year 2000 emissions.

However, if recalculations for structural 2000 emissions times five (number of years in the changes are made for the purposes of the target, they should be made for both the absolute emissions and the business metric. If the target business metric becomes irrelevant through a structural change, a reformulation of the target might be needed (e.g., when a company refocuses on a different industry but had used an industry-specific business metric before). 5. Define the target completion date The target completion date determines whether the target is relatively short- or long-term. Long-term targets (e.g., with a completion year ten years from the time the target is set) facilitate long-term planning for large capital investments with GHG benefits. However, they might encourage later phase-outs of less efficient equipment. Generally, long-term targets depend on uncertain future developments, which can have opportu- nities as well as risks, which is illustrated in Figure 13. A five-year target period may be more practical for organizations with shorter planning cycles. E C N A D I U G Setting a GHG Target FIGURE 13.

In this example, company A acquires company B, which has experienced organic GHG growth since the target base year (or \u201cstarting\u201d year). Under the rolling approach, emissions growth in the acquired company (B) from year 1 to year 2 does not appear as an emissions increase in relation to the target of the acquiring company (A). Thus company A would meet its stabilization target when using the rolling approach but not when using the fixed approach.

Decide on the use of GHG offsets or credits8 A GHG target can be met entirely from internal reduc- tions at sources included in the target boundary or through additionally using offsets that are generated from GHG reduction projects that reduce emissions at sources (or enhance sinks) external to the target boundary.9The use of offsets may be appropriate when SNOISSIME TIME TIME SNOISSIME SNOISSIME\n\nthe cost of internal reductions is high, opportunities for resulting difference is then divided by the corresponding reductions limited, or the company is unable to meet its metric.

Company C undertakes energy efficiency measures to reduce its indirect emissions from the use of the electricity. These will usually show up as reductions in both companies\u2019 targets.13 These two examples illustrate that double counting is inherent when the GHG sources where the reductions occur are included in more than one target of the same or different organizations. Without limiting the scope of targets it may be difficult to avoid this type of double counting and it probably does not matter if the double counting is restricted to the organizations sharing the same sources in their targets (i.e., when the two targets overlap).

Associated/affiliated company The parent company has significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the associated/affiliated company, but not financial control. (Chapter 3) Audit Trail Well organized and transparent historical records documenting how an inventory was compiled. Baseline A hypothetical scenario for what GHG emissions, removals or storage would have been in the absence of the GHG project or project activity. (Chapter 8) Base year A historic datum (a specific year or an average over multiple years) against which a company\u2019s emissions are tracked over time. (Chapter 5) Base year emissions GHG emissions in the base year. (Chapter 5) Base year emissions recalculation Recalculation of emissions in the base year to reflect a change in the structure of the company, or to reflect a change in the accounting methodology used. This ensures data consistency over time, i.e., comparisons of like with like over time. (Chapter 5, 11) Biofuels Fuel made from plant material, e.g. wood, straw and ethanol from plant matter (Chapter 4, 9, Appendix B) Boundaries GHG accounting and reporting boundaries can have several dimensions, i.e. organizational, opera- tional, geographic, business unit, and target boundaries. The inventory boundary determines which emissions are accounted and reported by the company. (Chapter 3, 4, 11) Cap and trade system A system that sets an overall emissions limit, allocates emissions allowances to participants, and allows them to trade allowances and emission credits with each other. (Chapter 2, 8, 11) Capital Lease A lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee and is accounted for as an asset on the balance sheet of the lessee. Also known as a Financial or Finance Lease. Leases other than Capital/Financial/Finance leases are Operating leases. Consult an accountant for further detail as definitions of lease types differ between various accepted financial standards. (Chapter 4) Carbon sequestration The uptake of CO and storage of carbon in biological sinks. 2 Clean Development Mechanism A mechanism established by Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol for project-based emission reduction (CDM) activities in developing countries.

The CDM allows for the creation, acquisition and transfer of CERs from climate change mitigation projects undertaken in non-Annex 1 countries. 96\n\nGLOSSARY 97 Certified Emission Reductions A unit of emission reduction generated by a CDM project. CERs are tradable commodities that can be (CERs) used by Annex 1 countries to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Co-generation unit/Combined A facility producing both electricity and steam/heat using the same fuel supply. (Chapter 3) heat and power (CHP) Consolidation Combination of GHG emissions data from separate operations that form part of one company or group of companies. (Chapter 3, 4) Control The ability of a company to direct the policies of another operation. More specifically, it is defined as either operational control (the organization or one of its subsidiaries has the full authority to introduce and implement its operating policies at the operation) or financial control (the organization has the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of the operation with a view to gaining economic benefits from its activities). (Chapter 3) Corporate inventory program A program to produce annual corporate inventories that are in keeping with the principles, standards, and guidance of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. This includes all institutional, managerial and technical arrangements made for the collection of data, preparation of a GHG inventory, and imple- mentation of the steps taken to manage the quality of their emission inventory. CO equivalent (CO -e) The universal unit of measurement to indicate the global warming potential (GWP) of each of the six 2 2 greenhouse gases, expressed in terms of the GWP of one unit of carbon dioxide. It is used to evaluate releasing (or avoiding releasing) different greenhouse gases against a common basis. Cross-sector calculation tool A GHG Protocol calculation tool that addresses GHG sources common to various sectors, e.g. emissions from stationary or mobile combustion. See also GHG Protocol calculation tools (www.ghgprotocol.org). Direct GHG emissions Emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting company. (Chapter 4) Direct monitoring Direct monitoring of exhaust stream contents in the form of continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) or periodic sampling. (Chapter 6) Double counting Two or more reporting companies take ownership of the same emissions or reductions. (Chapter 3, 4, 8, 11) Emissions The release of GHG into the atmosphere. Emission factor A factor allowing GHG emissions to be estimated from a unit of available activity data (e.g. tonnes of fuel consumed, tonnes of product produced) and absolute GHG emissions. (Chapter 6) Emission Reduction Unit (ERU) A unit of emission reduction generated by a Joint Implementation (JI) project. ERUs are tradable commodities which can be used by Annex 1 countries to help them meet their commitment under the Kyoto Protocol. Equity share The equity share reflects economic interest, which is the extent of rights a company has to the risks and rewards flowing from an operation. Typically, the share of economic risks and rewards in an oper- ation is aligned with the company's percentage ownership of that operation, and equity share will normally be the same as the ownership percentage. (Chapter 3) Estimation uncertainty Uncertainty that arises whenever GHGemissions are quantified, due to uncertainty in data inputs and calculation methodologies used to quantify GHGemissions. (Chapter 7) Finance lease A lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee and is accounted for as an asset on the balance sheet of the lessee. Also known as a Capital or Financial Lease. Leases other than Capital/Financial/Finance leases are Operating leases. Consult an accountant for further detail as definitions of lease types differ between various accepted accounting principles. (Chapter 4)\n\nGlossary Fixed asset investment Equipment, land, stocks, property, incorporated and non-incorporated joint ventures, and partnerships over which the parent company has neither significant influence nor control. (Chapter 3) Fugitive emissions Emissions that are not physically controlled but result from the intentional or unintentional releases of GHGs. They commonly arise from the production, processing transmission storage and use of fuels and other chemicals, often through joints, seals, packing, gaskets, etc. (Chapter 4, 6) Green power A generic term for renewable energy sources and specific clean energy technologies that emit fewer GHG emissions relative to other sources of energy that supply the electric grid", "embedding_index": 68}, {"chunk_id": "a744d3f6-e032-4b8d-80a7-0ea0ccb6ad99_69", "text": ". (Chapter 3) Fugitive emissions Emissions that are not physically controlled but result from the intentional or unintentional releases of GHGs. They commonly arise from the production, processing transmission storage and use of fuels and other chemicals, often through joints, seals, packing, gaskets, etc. (Chapter 4, 6) Green power A generic term for renewable energy sources and specific clean energy technologies that emit fewer GHG emissions relative to other sources of energy that supply the electric grid. Includes solar photovoltaic panels, solar thermal energy, geothermal energy, landfill gas, low-impact hydropower, and wind turbines. (Chapter 4) Greenhouse gases (GHG) For the purposes of this standard, GHGs are the six gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (CO); methane (CH); nitrous oxide (NO); hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and 2 4 2 sulphur hexafluoride (SF). 6 GHG capture Collection of GHG emissions from a GHG source for storage in a sink. GHG credit GHG offsets can be converted into GHG credits when used to meet an externally imposed target. A GHG credit is a convertible and transferable instrument usually bestowed by a GHG program. (Chapter 8, 11) GHG offset Offsets are discrete GHG reductions used to compensate for (i.e., offset) GHG emissions elsewhere, for example to meet a voluntary or mandatory GHG target or cap. Offsets are calculated relative to a baseline that represents a hypothetical scenario for what emissions would have been in the absence of the mitigation project that generates the offsets. To avoid double counting, the reduction giving rise to the offset must occur at sources or sinks not included in the target or cap for which it is used. GHG program A generic term used to refer to any voluntary or mandatory international, national, sub-national, government or non-governmental authority that registers, certifies, or regulates GHG emissions or removals outside the company. e.g. CDM, EU ETS, CCX, and CCAR. GHG project A specific project or activity designed to achieve GHG emission reductions, storage of carbon, or enhancement of GHG removals from the atmosphere. GHG projects may be stand-alone projects, or specific activities or elements within a larger non-GHG related project. (Chapter 8, 11) GHG Protocol calculation tools A number of cross-sector and sector-specific tools that calculate GHG emissions on the basis of activity data and emission factors (available at www.ghgprotocol.org). GHG Protocol Initiative Amulti-stakeholder collaboration convened by the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development to design, develop and promote the use of accounting and reporting standards for business. It comprises of two separate but linked standards\u2014the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standardand the GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard. GHGProtocol Project An additional module of the GHG Protocol Initiative addressing the quantification of GHG Quantification Standard reduction projects. This includes projects that will be used to offset emissions elsewhere and/or generate credits. More information available at www.ghgprotocol.org.

Leases other than Operating leases are Capital/Financial/Finance leases. Consult an accountant for further detail as definitions of lease types differ between various accepted financial standards. (Chapter ", "embedding_index": 70}, {"chunk_id": "a744d3f6-e032-4b8d-80a7-0ea0ccb6ad99_71", "text": ", or legal structures. An operation can be a facility, subsidiary, affiliated company or other form of joint venture. (Chapter 3, 4) Operating lease A lease which does not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee and is not recorded as an asset in the balance sheet of the lessee. Leases other than Operating leases are Capital/Financial/Finance leases. Consult an accountant for further detail as definitions of lease types differ between various accepted financial standards. (Chapter 4) Operational boundaries The boundaries that determine the direct and indirect emissions associated with operations owned or controlled by the reporting company. This assessment allows a company to establish which operations and sources cause direct and indirect emissions, and to decide which indirect emissions to include that are a consequence of its operations. (Chapter 4) Organic growth/decline Increases or decreases in GHG emissions as a result of changes in production output, product mix, plant closures and the opening of new plants.

(Chapter 10) Secondary effects (Leakage) GHG emissions changes resulting from the project not captured by the primary effect(s). These are typically the small, unintended GHG consequences of a project. (Chapter 8) Sequestered atmospheric carbon Carbon removed from the atmosphere by biological sinks and stored in plant tissue. Sequestered atmospheric carbon does not include GHGs captured through carbon capture and storage. Significance threshold A qualitative or quantitative criteria used to define a significant structural change. It is the responsi- bility of the company/ verifier to determine the \u201csignificance threshold\u201d for considering base year emissions recalculation. In most cases the \u201csignificance threshold\u201d depends on the use of the infor- mation, the characteristics of the company, and the features of structural changes. (Chapter 5) Stationary Combustion Burning of fuels to generate electricity, steam, heat, or power in stationary equipment such as boilers, furnaces etc. Structural change A change in the organizational or operational boundaries of a company that result in the transfer of ownership or control of emissions from one company to another.

It applies only to companies that engage in trading (sale or purchase) of offsets or whose corporate target boundaries interface with other companies\u2019 targets or external programs. (Chapter 11) Uncertainty 1. Statistical definition: A parameter associated with the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could be reasonably attributed to the measured quantity. (e.g., the sample variance or coefficient of variation). (Chapter 7) 2. Inventory definition: A general and imprecise term which refers to the lack of certainty in emissions- related data resulting from any causal factor, such as the application of non-representative factors or methods, incomplete data on sources and sinks, lack of transparency etc. Reported uncertainty information typically specifies a quantitative estimates of the likely or perceived difference between a reported value and a qualitative description of the likely causes of the difference.
