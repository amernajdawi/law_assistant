Those economic sectors and activities were chosen because of their share in overall greenhouse gas emissions, and their proven potential for avoiding the production of greenhouse gas emissions, reducing such emissions, or removing such emissions. In addition, those economic sectors and activities have a proven potential to enable such avoidance, reduction and removal for other economic sectors and activities, or to ensure long-term storage of such emissions for other sectors and activities. (2) The total energy use accounts for approximately 75 % of direct greenhouse gas emissions in the Union. Thus, the energy sector has a crucial role in continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The technical screening criteria laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 therefore cover a wide range of economic sectors and activities related to the energy supply chain, ranging from electricity or heat generation from different sources, through transmission and distribution networks to storage, as well as heat pumps and the manufacture of biogas and biofuels. However, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 does not contain technical screening criteria for economic activities in the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors, despite their potential to contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union\u2019s economy. (3) As set out in Commission Communication of 21 April 2021 (\u2018EU Taxonomy, Corporate Sustainability Reporting, Sustainability Preferences and Fiduciary Duties: Directing finance towards the European Green Deal\u2019) and in Commission Communication of 6 July 2021 (\u2018Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy\u2019), theestablishment of technical screening criteria for energy generation from fossil gas was postponed in view of the (1) OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13. (2) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives (OJ L 442, 9.12.2021, p. 1).\n\nL 188/2 EN Official Journal of the European Union 15.7.2022 need for further technical assessment, notably on the transitional role of fossil gas in the decarbonisation of the economy(3). The establishment of technical screening criteria for nuclear energy generation activities was also postponed awaiting an in-depth expert assessment, launched in 2020, of whether the nuclear life-cycle, and notably nuclear waste, could be considered compatible with the requirement, laid down in Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, that an activity can do no significant harm to other environmental objectives. In the light of those assessments, it is necessary to recognise that the fossil gas and nuclear energy generation activities can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union\u2019s economy. (4) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 covering transitional economic activities, it is necessary to lay down technical screening criteria for electricity generation, high-efficiency co-generation of power and heat/cool, and production of heat/cool in efficient district heating and cooling systems from fossil gas, where greenhouse gas emissions from fossil gas are below an appropriate threshold. In addition, it is necessary to lay down technical screening criteria for the use of fossil gas in electricity generation, high-efficiency co-generation of power and heat/cool, and production of heat/cool in efficient district heating and cooling systems,", "embedding_index": 0}, {"chunk_id": "405136cd-c760-43b4-b44a-ecfa487499fa_1", "text": " to lay down technical screening criteria for electricity generation, high-efficiency co-generation of power and heat/cool, and production of heat/cool in efficient district heating and cooling systems from fossil gas, where greenhouse gas emissions from fossil gas are below an appropriate threshold. In addition, it is necessary to lay down technical screening criteria for the use of fossil gas in electricity generation, high-efficiency co-generation of power and heat/cool, and production of heat/cool in efficient district heating and cooling systems, where such electricity generation, high-efficiency co-generation of power and heat/cool, and production of heat/cool in efficient district heating and cooling systems do not yet comply with that appropriate threshold, as in addition to the use of climate- neutral energy and more investments in already low-carbon economic activities and sectors, the transition requires substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in other economic activities and sectors for which there are no technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives. All those economic activities should be qualified as transitional under Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, given that technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives may not yet be commercially available at a sufficient scale to cover the energy demand in a continuous and reliable manner. In particular, for electricity generation, it is appropriate to provide for an alternative approach to directly limiting the greenhouse gas emissions. Under this alternative approach, that should deliver similar results over a 20 years period, facilities may reach such results by limiting the number of hours in operation or by advancing the switch to renewable or low-carbon gases to an earlier date. The technical screening criteria should facilitate an accelerated phase-out from more emissions-intensive energy sources, including solid fossil fuels. In addition, in order to fulfil the requirements laid down in Article 10(2), first subparagraph, points (a), (b) and (c), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the technical screening criteria for the use of fossil gas should also ensure that robust evidence is available to demonstrate that the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources, and that effective plans are put in place for each facility, in line with the best performance in the sector, to switch entirely to renewables or low carbon gases by a specific date. Finally, the technical screening criteria should provide for a time-limited recognition of the contribution of those activities to decarbonisation. (5) Renewables will play a fundamental role in meeting the climate and environmental goals of the Union. In that light, investments in renewables need to scale-up to meet the needs of the energy market of the Union for more renewable and clean energy. (6) Nuclear energy-related activities are low-carbon activities, they do not constitute energy from renewable sources as defined in Article 2, second subparagraph, point (1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), and as referred to in Article 10(1), point (a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and do not fall under the other categories of economic activities listed in points (b) to (i) of that provision. Such nuclear energy related economic activities should be qualified under Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in the absence of technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternative at a sufficient scale to cover the energy demand in a continuous and reliable manner. In addition, in the Final Report of the Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance from March 2020(5), it was stated that \u2018nuclear energy generation has near to zero green-house gas emissions in the energy generation phase\u2019 and \u2018evidence on the potential substantial contribution of nuclear energy to climate change mitigation objectives was extensive and clear\u2019. Moreover, a number of Member States\u2019 plans include nuclear energy along with renewable energy in the energy sources to be used to meet climate targets, (3) Communication from the Commission of 21 April 2021 to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, EU Taxonomy, Corporate Sustainability Reporting, Sustainability Preferences and Fiduciary Duties: Directing finance towards the European Green Deal (COM(2021) 188 final) and Communication from the Commission of 6 July 2021 to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy (COM(2021) 390 final).

Finally, by providing a stable baseload of energy supply, nuclear energy facilitates the deployment of intermittent renewable sources and does not hamper their development, as required by Article 10(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. Nuclear energy related activities should therefore be considered as complying with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. (7) Scientific review conducted by experts(7) concluded that technical screening criteria for nuclear energy related economic activities should ensure that no significant harm is done to other environmental objectives due to potential risks arising from the long-term storageand final disposal of nuclear waste. Those technical screening criteria should therefore reflect the highest standards of nuclear safety, radiation protection and radioactive waste management, building upon requirements laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (\u2018Euratom Treaty\u2019) and in legislation adopted under that Treaty, and in particular in Council Directive 2009/71/Euratom(8). That Directive contains a high-level nuclear safety objective covering all stages of the life- cycle of each nuclear installation, including the siting, design, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of such installations. In particular, that Directive calls for significant safety enhancements in the design of new reactors, including the so-called Generation III+ reactors, for which state of the art knowledge and technology should be used, taking into account the latest international safety requirements. Those requirements provide for an effective implementation of the nuclear safety objective, including the application of the defence-in- depth principle and of an effective safety culture. Those requirements ensure that the impact of extreme human- made and natural hazards, including earthquakes and floods, is minimised and that accidents, abnormal operations and failures or loss of control systems are prevented, inter alia, by protective structures or back-up cooling and electricity supply systems. (8) Accident-tolerant fuel for nuclear power plants which provides additional protection against accidents resulting from structural damages to fuel or reactor components has become available in the market. In order to take into account those recent technological developments, the use of that type of fuel should be set out as a requirement in the technical screening criteria, taking into account its licensing within the Union. (9) Worldwide, research and development efforts are ongoing to develop new nuclear reactor technologies that use, among others, closed fuel cycles or fuel self-breeding concepts and that minimise the production of high-level radioactive waste (\u2018Generation IV reactors\u2019). Although those Generation IV reactors are not yet commercially viable, technical screening criteria should be laid down for such reactors in light of their potential contribution to the objective of decarbonisation and minimisation of radioactive waste. (10) Nuclear energy is part of the future energy sources in a number of Member States, as part of their decarbonisation efforts. The scenarios assessed by the Commission lead to a decarbonised energy system based on renewables to a very large extent and on nuclear energy with a stable installed capacity compared to current levels. As the nuclear installations being currently exploited age, they need safety upgrades to extend operational life as well as newly built nuclear installations to replace obsolete installations. This is a continuous process that should ensure the availability of the necessary capacity for the decarbonisation of the energy system by 2050 and beyond this date as needed. Accordingly, significant investments in nuclear energy will be needed throughout the period until 2050 and beyond. It is necessary to ensure that new nuclear power plants use the most advanced solutions resulting from technological progress. The technical screening criteria for such new nuclear power plants should therefore provide for regular reviews of each investment project, and for technical parameters that correspond to the best-available technology in view of the outcomes of sustained research and development efforts and the continuous improvements of technologies. Specific dates should be defined to ensure phasing in of new technologies compatible with sustainable decarbonisation as soon as they become available.

To ensure, for the purpose of meeting the goals of the taxonomy, the highest possible regard to the principles and requirements of the Euratom legislation, including the nuclear safety objective, such investments should be subject to an opinion from the Commission, irrespective of whether Annex II to the Euratom Treaty and Regulation (Euratom) No 2587/1999 require any notification. For the same reason, all issues concerning the application of Article 10(2) and Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and the technical screening criteria identified by the Commission in its opinion should be satisfactorily addressed. (12) In view of the long lead times for investments in new nuclear generation capacity, extending the service time of selected existing nuclear installations can support the decarbonisation of the energy system in the near to medium term. The technical screening criteria for such extensions should, however, require modifications and safety upgrades to ensure that those nuclear installations comply with the highest achievable safety standards and with all safety objective requirements laid down in legislation adopted under the Euratom Treaty. (13) In the light of the expected technological and scientific developments, investments in the construction and safe operation of new nuclear installations using best available technologies and approved by an appropriate date by Member States\u2019 competent authorities in accordance with applicable national law should be subject to technical screening criteria and to time-limits that will encourage the development and future use of Generation IV reactors with closed fuel cycle or fuel self-breeding once they become commercially available. These time-limits should be appropriately reviewed in light of progress in the development of such technologies. (14) The technical screening criteria related to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation objectives should ensure that economic activities do not cause significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives. Specifically for nuclear energy related economic activities, it is necessary to ensure that the long term disposal of waste does not cause significant and long-term harm to the environment, as referred to in Article 17(1), point (d) (iii), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. It is therefore appropriate to set out in the technical screening criteria specific requirements for a radioactive waste management fund and a nuclear decommissioning fund, which can be combined, in line with the principle that waste generators should be responsible for the cost of managing it, and to require operational final disposal facilities for all radioactive waste, which should prevent any export of radioactive waste for disposal in third countries. In several Member States, low and intermediate level radioactive waste is currently being disposed of in near-surface disposal facilities already, and substantial experience and know-how in waste management have been accumulated during decades of operating those near-surface disposal facilities. For high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel, deep geological disposal represents the state of the art solution that is broadly accepted in the expert community worldwide as the safest and the most sustainable option for the end point of the management of high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel considered as waste. Member States, while retaining responsibility for their policies in respect of the management of their spent fuel and low, intermediate or high-level radioactive waste, should include planning and implementation of disposal options in their national policies, in particular under the national programmes for the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, covering all types of spent fuel and radioactive waste and all stages of spent fuel and radioactive waste management from generation to disposal. The national programmes\u2019 content is specified in Council Directive", "embedding_index": 3}, {"chunk_id": "405136cd-c760-43b4-b44a-ecfa487499fa_4", "text": " radioactive waste and spent fuel considered as waste. Member States, while retaining responsibility for their policies in respect of the management of their spent fuel and low, intermediate or high-level radioactive waste, should include planning and implementation of disposal options in their national policies, in particular under the national programmes for the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, covering all types of spent fuel and radioactive waste and all stages of spent fuel and radioactive waste management from generation to disposal. The national programmes\u2019 content is specified in Council Directive 2011/70/Euratom(10) and includes key performance indicators to monitor progress transparently. The Member States have to report regularly on the progress of implementation of the national programmes to the Commission. Reporting from Member States from 2021 demonstrates that substantial progress is made in the realisation of the first deep geological disposal facilities on the Union territory. Realistic solutions are becoming available for Member States to develop and operate such facilities by 2050. Therefore, the inclusion of a corresponding requirement in the technical screening criteria ensures that no significant harm is caused to the environment.

To provide that transparency, specific disclosure requirements for non-financial and financial undertakings should be laid down. In order to ensure comparability of the information disclosed to investors, that information should be presented in the form of a template that indicates clearly the proportion of fossil gas and nuclear energy activities in the denominator and, where appropriate, the numerator of key performance indicators of those undertakings. In order to provide a high degree of transparency to investors in financial products referred to in Article 5 and Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 concerning exposures to fossil gas and nuclear energy activities, for which technical screening criteria are laid down, the Commission will amend or propose to amend the disclosure framework pertaining to those financial products as appropriate to provide for full transparency over the whole life of those financial products. To ensure that such information is clearly identified by end-investors, the Commission will consider amending the requirements on the financial and insurance advice given by distributors. (16) To enhance investor confidence, compliance with the technical screening criteria related to fossil gas activities should be verified by an independent third party. To ensure an impartial and diligent verification of compliance, the independent third-party should have the resources and expertise to perform that verification, be independent to avoid any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and should not be involved in the development or operation of such fossil gas activities. In addition to the verification mechanism, financial and non-financial undertakings may be subject to specific verification requirements provided in other Union legislation on sustainable finance that cover compliance with the technical screening criteria. In accordance with Article 26(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the Commission should review the provisions required for setting up verification mechanisms of compliance with the criteria set out in that Regulation. (17) The fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors are characterised by rapid technological development. It is therefore necessary to review the technical screening criteria covering energy generation activities in those sectors regularly, as required by Article 19(5) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. In addition, based on the conditions laid down in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, such review should cover the appropriateness of the periods of time laid down in the technical screening criteria. (18) Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178(11)should therefore be amended accordingly. The amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 do not mandate any investments, but are intended to help financial markets and investors to identify, subject to strict conditions, relevant gas and nuclear related activities needed for the transition of the Member States\u2019 energy systems towards climate neutrality in line with Union climate goals and commitments.
